We're stoked to announce the release of [bigrquery](http://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/) 1.4.2. bigrquery makes it easy to work with data stored in [Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/), a hosted database for big data.

You can install it from CRAN with:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html'>install.packages</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"bigquery"</span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

This has been the first major update to bigrquery for a while, and is mostly about catching up with innovations elsewhere as well as squashing a bunch of smaller annoyances.

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='kr'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html'>library</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='nv'><a href='https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org'>bigrquery</a></span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

Here's a summary of the biggest changes:

-   bigrquery is now [MIT licensed](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/relicensing-packages/).

-   Deprecated functions (i.e.Â those not starting with `bq_`) have been removed. These have been superseded for a long time and were formally deprecated in bigrquery 1.3.0 (2020).

-   [`bq_table_download()`](https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/reference/bq_table_download.html) now returns unknown fields as character vectors. In particular, this means that `BIGNUMERIC` and `JSON` columns are downloaded into R for you to process as you wish. [`bq_table_download()`](https://bigrquery.r-dbi.org/reference/bq_table_download.html) now uses the [clock package](https://clock.r-lib.org) to parse dates, leading to a considerable performance improvement and correct parsing for dates prior to 1970-01-01.

-   bigquery datasets and tables will now appear in the [RStudio connections pane](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/data/data-connections.html) when connecting with [`DBI::dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html).

-   `DBI::dbAppendTable(),` [`DBI::dbCreateTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbCreateTable.html), and [`DBI::dbExecute()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbExecute.html) are now supported, and [`DBI::dbGetQuery()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbGetQuery.html)/[`DBI::dbSendQuery()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbSendQuery.html) support parameterised queries via the `params` argument. [`DBI::dbReadTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbReadTable.html), [`DBI::dbWriteTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbWriteTable.html), [`DBI::dbExistsTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbExistsTable.html), [`DBI::dbRemoveTable()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbRemoveTable.html), and [`DBI::dbListFields()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbListFields.html) now all work with [`DBI::Id()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/Id.html).

-   bigrquery now uses 2nd edition of dbplyr interface and is compatible with dbplyr 2.4.0.
