We are chuffed once again to offer a summer internship with the tidymodels team. 

We've had eight previous summer interns and these led to the creation of a number of new packages: [applicable](https://applicable.tidymodels.org/), [agua](https://agua.tidymodels.org/), [butcher](https://butcher.tidymodels.org/), [bundle](https://rstudio.github.io/bundle/), [shinymodels](https://shinymodels.tidymodels.org/), [spatialsample](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/), and [stacks](https://stacks.tidymodels.org/). Our own [Simon Couch](https://www.simonpcouch.com/) is a former intern who won [an award](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/john-m-chambers) for his work. 

This year, the primary focus is on expanding our feature selection capabilities. Some of this will involve new recipe steps and other functions. Towards the end of the internship, there might be time to work on other things, too!

To apply, make sure that you have a GitHub handle and follow this link: 


This year, the internship is US-based.  

We can't wait to get started.
