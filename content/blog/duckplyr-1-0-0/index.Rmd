We're very chuffed to announce the release of [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org) 1.0.0, 
a package powered by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
It joins the rank of dplyr backends together with [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org) and [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org).
You can use it instead of dplyr for data small or large.

<!-- FIXME:

We have many more dplyr backends, the two above are just from the tidyverse.
GitHub search: https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+%2FS3method%5B%28%5D%28mutate%7Csummarise%29+*%2C%2F&type=code
Do we need an "awesome dplyr" like https://github.com/krlmlr/awesome-vctrs/?

-->

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("duckplyr")
```

In this article, we'll show how duckplyr can help you with data of different size, explain how you can help improve the package, and ... .

## A drop-in replacement for dplyr

The duckplyr package is a _drop-in replacement for dplyr_ that uses _DuckDB for speed_.
You can simply _drop_ duckplyr into your pipeline by loading it, then computations will be efficiently carried out by DuckDB.
DuckDB is a fast in-memory analytical database system[^duckdb].

[^duckdb]: If you haven't heard about it, you can watch [Hannes Mühleisen's keynote at posit::conf(2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GELhdezYmP0&feature=youtu.be).


```{r}
library(conflicted)
library(duckplyr)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
library(babynames)

out <- babynames |>
  mutate(prevalence = if_else(prop >= 0.01, "frequent", "rare")) |>
  summarize(
    .by = c(sex, year, prevalence),
    babies_n = sum(n)
  ) |>
  filter(sex == "F")
class(out)
out
```

Like with other dplyr backends like dtplyr and dbplyr, duckplyr allows you to get faster results.
Unlike other dplyr backends, duckplyr does not require you to learn a different syntax.

The duckplyr package is fully compatible with dplyr: if an operation cannot be carried out with DuckDB, it is automatically outsourced to dplyr.
Over time, we expect fewer and fewer fallbacks to dplyr to be needed.

## How to use duckplyr

To _replace_ dplyr with duckplyr, you can:

- Load duckplyr and then keep your pipeline as is. Calling `library(duckplyr)` overwrites dplyr methods, enabling duckplyr for the entire session no matter how data.frames are created.
    This is shown in the example above.

- Create individual "duck frames" using _conversion functions_ like `duckdb_tibble()` or `as_duckdb_tibble()`, or _ingestion functions_ like `read_csv_duckdb()`.


Then, the data manipulation pipeline uses the exact same syntax as a dplyr pipeline.
The duckplyr package performs the computation using DuckDB.

```{r}
# Undo the effect of library(duckplyr)
methods_restore()

out <- babynames |>
  as_duckdb_tibble() |>
  mutate(prevalence = if_else(prop >= 0.01, "frequent", "rare")) |>
  summarize(
    .by = c(sex, year, prevalence),
    babies_n = sum(n)
  ) |>
  filter(sex == "F")
class(out)
```

In both cases, printing the result only shows the first few rows, as with dbplyr.

```{r}
out
```

The result can finally be materialized to memory, or computed temporarily, or computed to a file.

```{r}
# to memory
nrow(out)
# or for instance collect(out)

# to a file
csv_file <- withr::local_tempfile()
compute_csv(out, csv_file)
fs::file_size(csv_file)
```

When duckplyr itself does not support specific functionality, it falls back to dplyr.
For instance, filtering on grouped data is not supported yet, still it works thanks to the fallback mechanism.

```{r}
babynames |>
  filter(n > 10000, .by = "name")
```

For performance reasons, the output order of the result is not guaranteed to be stable.
If you need a stable order, you can use `arrange()` or force output order stability by setting an environment variable.
This and other limitations are documented in [`vignette("limits")`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/limits.html).

## Large data

For large data, duckplyr is a legitimate alternative to dtplyr and dbplyr.

With large datasets, you want:

- input data in an efficient format, like Parquet files, which duckplyr allows thanks to its ingestion functions like `read_parquet_duckdb()`.
- efficient computation, which duckplyr provides via DuckDB's holistic optimization, without your having to use another syntax than dplyr.
- the output to not clutter all the memory, which duckplyr supports through two features:
    - computation to files using  [`compute_parquet()`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/compute_file.html) or [`compute_csv()`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/compute_file.html).
    - the control of automatic materialization (collection of results into memory). You can disable automatic materialization completely or, as a compromise, disable it up to a certain output size. See [`vignette("prudence")`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/prudence.html) for details.

See [`vignette("large")`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/large.html) for a walkthrough and more details.

A drawback of analyzing large data with duckplyr is that the limitations of duckplyr won't be compensated by fallbacks, since fallbacks to dplyr necessitate putting data into memory.
Therefore, if your pipeline encounters fallbacks, you might want to work around them by converting the duck frame into a table through `compute()` then running SQL code through the experimental `read_sql_duckdb()` function.
Again, over time, we expect more native support for dplyr functionality.

```{r}
data <-
  duckdb_tibble(a = 2) |>
  mutate(b = 3)

computed_data <-
  data |>
  compute(name = "computed_data")

sql_data <-
  read_sql_duckdb("SELECT *, a * b AS c FROM computed_data")

sql_data
```

## Help us improve duckplyr!

Our goals for future development of duckplyr include:

- Enabling users to provide [custom translations](https://github.com/tidyverse/duckplyr/issues/158) of dplyr functionality;
- Making it easier to contribute code to duckplyr;
- Supporting more dplyr and tidyr functionality natively in DuckDB.

You can help!

- Please report any issues, especially regarding unknown incompabilities. See [`vignette("limits")`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/limits.html).
- Contribute to the codebase after reading duckplyr's [contributing guide](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/CONTRIBUTING.html).
- Turn on telemetry to help us hear about the most frequent fallbacks so we can prioritize working on the corresponding missing dplyr translation. See [`vignette("telemetry")`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/telemetry.html) and the [`duckplyr::fallback_sitrep()`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/fallback.html) function.

A big thanks to all folks who filed issues, created PRs and generally helped to improve duckplyr!

<!-- FIXME: Can we use_tidy_thanks also for the duckdb repo?, and perhaps merge the two? -->
