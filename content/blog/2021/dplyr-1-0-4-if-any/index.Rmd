We're happy to announce the release of [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) 1.0.4, featuring: 
two new functions `if_all()` and `if_any()`, and improved performance improvements of `across()`. 

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

You can see a full list of changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/releases/tag/v1.0.4). 

## if_any() and if_all()

The new `across()` function introduced as part of 
[dplyr 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/) is proving to be 
a successful addition to dplyr. In case you missed it, `across()` lets you 
conveniently express a set of actions to be performed across a tidy selection 
of columns. 

`across()` is very useful within `summarise()` and `mutate()`, but it's hard to use it with `filter()` because it is not clear how the results would be combined into one logical vector. 
So to fill the gap, we're introducing two new functions `if_all()` and `if_any()`. Let's 
directly dive in to an example: 

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(palmerpenguins)

big <- function(x) {
  x > mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}

# keep rows if all the selected columns are "big"
penguins %>% 
  filter(if_all(contains("bill"), big))

# keep rows where at least one of the columns is "big"
penguins %>% 
  filter(if_any(contains("bill"), big))
```

Both functions operate similarly to `across()` but go the extra mile of aggregating the 
results to indicate if *all* the results are true when using `if_all()`, or if *at least 
one* is true when using `if_any()`. 

Although `if_all()` and `if_any()` were designed with `filter()` in mind, we 
[then discovered](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/5709) that they can also be
useful within `mutate()` and/or `summarise()`: 

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
  mutate(
    category = case_when(
      if_all(contains("bill"), big) ~ "both big", 
      if_any(contains("bill"), big) ~ "one big", 
      TRUE                          ~ "small"
    )) %>% 
  count(category)
```

## Faster across()

One of the main motivations for across() was eliminating the need for 
every verb to have a `_at`, `_if`, and `_all` variant. Unfortunately, however, this came with a performance cost. In this release, we have redesigned `across()` to eliminate that performance penalty in many cases. In the following example, you can now see that the old and new approaches take the same amount of time.

```{r}
library(vroom)

mun2014 <- vroom(
  "https://data.regardscitoyens.org/elections/2014_municipales/MN14_Bvot_T1_01-49.txt", 
  col_select = -c('X4','X9','X10','X11'), col_types = list(), col_names = FALSE, 
  locale = locale(encoding = "WINDOWS-1252"), altrep = FALSE
) 

bench::workout({
  a <- mun2014 %>% group_by_if(is.character)
  b <- a %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, sum)
})

bench::workout({
  c <- mun2014 %>% group_by(across(where(is.character)))
  d <- c %>% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) 
})
```
