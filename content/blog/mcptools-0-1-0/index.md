We're hootin' to holler about the initial release of mcptools, a package implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in R. MCP standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. In the context of R:

-   R can be treated as the MCP **Server**, meaning that applications like Claude Code, VS Code Copilot Chat, and Cursor can run R code to better answer user queries.
-   R can also serve as the MCP **Client**, where users converse with LLMs via [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/) and additional tools are provided to access context from third-party MCP servers like Slack servers, GitHub PRs/issues, Google Drive documents, and Confluence sites.

You can install it from CRAN with:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html'>install.packages</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"mcptools"</span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

This blog post will highlight some use cases for R as an MCP server and client. See the [package website](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/) for a more thorough overview of what's possible with mcptools!

## R as a server

Treating R as an MCP server makes coding assistants better at writing R code. Applications like Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Copilot Chat in VS Code, and Positron Assistant can be configured with arbitrary R functions that allow them to e.g.Â peruse R package documentation, run R code, and look at objects in your interactive R sessions in order to write better code:

<div class="highlight">

The Client box lists AI coding assistants including Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Copilot Chat in VS Code, and Positron Assistant. The Server is initiated with [`mcp_server()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/server.html) and contains tools for R functions like reading package documentation, running R code, and inspecting global environment objects. Sessions can be configured with [`mcp_session()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/server.html) and can optionally connect to interactive R sessions, with two example projects shown: 'Some R Project' and 'Other R Project'." width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

</div>

Hooking Claude Code (or other coding assistants) up to tools that can peruse R package documentation allows me to say things like "read the docs for all of the functions I use in \[some file\] and then ...". The [btw package](https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/reference/mcp.html) provides helpers to start MCP servers with tools to peruse R package documentation. To use those tools with Claude Code, for example, install btw and then write `claude mcp add -s "user" r-btw -- Rscript -e "btw::btw_mcp_server()"` in your terminal.

To use [R as an MCP server](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/articles/server.html), configure the command `Rscript -e "mcptools::mcp_server()"` with your LLM application. You'll likely want to provide a `tools` argument, perhaps `tools = btw::btw_tools()`, to configure additional R functions as tools in the server.

## R as a client

Treating R as an MCP client means that your [shinychat](https://posit-dev.github.io/shinychat/) and [querychat](https://posit-dev.github.io/querychat/) applications will have easy access to your organization's data, regardless of whether that lives in a Slack server, Google Drive, Confluence site, GitHub organization, or elsewhere.

<div class="highlight">

<img src="r_as_a_client.png" alt="An architecture diagram showing the Client (left) with R code using the ellmer library to create a chat object and then setting tools from mcp with [`mcp_tools()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/client.html), and the Server (right) containing third-party tools including GitHub (for reading PRs/Issues), Confluence (for searching), and Google Drive (for searching). Bidirectional arrows indicate communication between the client and server components." width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

</div>

For example, if I'd like a chat app built with Shiny to be able to search a Slack server's history, I could configure the [Slack MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/slack#usage-with-claude-desktop) and then register tools from [`mcp_tools()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/client.html) with the ellmer chat underlying the app.

To use [R as an MCP client](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/client.html), paste the Claude Desktop configuration `.json` for your desired MCP server (often found on MCP server READMEs) into the mcptools configuration file, and then call [`mcp_tools()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/reference/client.html) for a list of ellmer tool definitions that can be registered with an ellmer chat using the [`set_tools()` method](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/reference/Chat.html?q=set_tools#method-set-tools-).

This package was written with Winston Chang and Charlie Gao, both of whose contributions were indespensable in bringing the package from a clunky, hard-to-install demo to what it is now.
