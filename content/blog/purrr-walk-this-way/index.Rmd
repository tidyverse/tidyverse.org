## Meet the `map()` family

purrr's `map()` family of functions are tools for **iteration**, performing the same action on multiple inputs.
If you're new to purrr, the [Iteration chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#iteration) of R for Data Science is a good place to get started.

One of the benefits of using `map()` is that the function has variants (e.g. `map2()`, `pmap()`, etc.) all of which work the same way.
To borrow from Jennifer Thompson's excellent [Intro to purrr](https://github.com/jenniferthompson/RLadiesIntroToPurrr),the arguments can be broken into two groups: what we're iterating over, and what we're doing each time.
The adapted figure below shows what this looks like for `map()`, `map2()`, and `pmap()`.

```{r}
#| label: map-args
#| echo: FALSE
#| fig.align: 'center'
#| fig.cap: Grouped map function arguments, adapted from Intro to purrr by Jennifer Thompson
#| fig.alt: "Highlighted titles read: what we're iterating over, and what we're doing each time. For map(.x = , .f = ) .x is what we're iterating over and .f is what we're doing each time. For map2(.x = , .y = , .f = ) .x and .y are what we're iterating over and .f is what we're doing each time. For pmap(.l = list(), .f = ) .l is what we're iterating over and .f is what we're doing each time."

```

In addition to handling different input arguments, the map family of functions has variants that create different outputs.
The following table from the [Map-variants section of Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html#map-variants) shows how the orthogonal inputs and outputs can be used to organise the variants into a matrix:

|                      | List     | Atomic            | Same type   | Nothing   |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| One argument         | `map()`  | `map_lgl()`, ...  | `modify()`  | `walk()`  |
| Two arguments        | `map2()` | `map2_lgl()`, ... | `modify2()` | `walk2()` |
| One argument + index | `imap()` | `imap_lgl()`, ... | `imodify()` | `iwalk()` |
| N arguments          | `pmap()` | `pmap_lgl()`, ... | ---         | `pwalk()` |

## What's up with `walk()`?

Based on the table above, you might think that `walk()` isn't very useful.
Indeed, `walk()`, `walk2()`, and `pwalk()` all invisibly return `.x`.
However, they come in handy when you want to call a function for its ***side effects*** rather than its return value.

Here, we'll go through two common use cases: saving multiple CSVs, and multiple plots.
We'll also make use of the [fs](https://fs.r-lib.org/) package, a cross-platform interface to file system operations, to inspect our outputs.

If you want to try this out but don't want to save files locally, there's a [companion project on **Posit Cloud**](https://posit.cloud/content/5983147) where you can follow along.

```{r}
#| label: try-it
#| echo: false
blogdown::shortcode("test-drive-cloud", url = "https://posit.cloud/content/5983147")
```

## Writing (and deleting) multiple CSVs

To get started, we'll need some data.
Let's use the [gapminder](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_examples.html) example Sheet built into [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/).
Because there are multiple worksheets (one for each continent), we'll use `map()` to apply `read_sheet()`[^1] to each one, and get back a list of data frames.

```{r}
#| label: libs
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
```

```{r}
#| label: deauth
#| echo: false
gs4_deauth()
```

```{r}
#| label: read-sheets
ss <- gs4_example("gapminder") # get sheet id
sheets <- sheet_names(ss) # get the names of individual sheets
gap_dfs <- map(sheets, .f = \(x) read_sheet(ss, sheet = x))
```

Note that the backslash syntax for anonymous functions (e.g. `\(x) x + 1`) was introduced in base R version 4.1.0 as a shorthand for `function(x) x + 1`.
If you're using an earlier version of R, you can use purrr's shorthand: a formula (e.g. `~ .x + 1`).

Typically, you'd want to combine these data frames into one to make it easier to work with your data.
To do so, we'll use `list_rbind()` on `gap_dfs`.
I've kept the intermediary object, since we'll use it in a moment with `walk()`, but could have just as easily piped the output directly.
The combination of `purrr::map()` and `list_rbind()` is a handy one that you can learn more about in the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration.html?#purrrmap-and-list_rbind).

```{r}
#| label: combine-dfs
gap_combined <- gap_dfs |>
  list_rbind()
```

Now let's say that, for whatever reason, you'd like to save the data from these sheets as individual CSVs.
This is where `walk()` comes into play---writing out the file with `write_csv()` is a "side effect." We'll use [`fs::dir_create()`](https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/create.html) to create a data folder to put our files into[^2], and build a vector of paths/file names.
Since we have two arguments, the list of data frames, and the paths, we'll use `walk2()`.

```{r}
#| label: write-csvs
fs::dir_create("data")
paths <- str_glue("data/gapminder_{tolower(sheets)}.csv")
walk2(
  gap_dfs, 
  paths,
  \(df, name) write_csv(df, name)
  )
```

To see what we've done, we can use [`fs::dir_tree()`](https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/dir_tree.html) to see the contents of the directory as a tree, or [`fs::dir_ls()`](https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/dir_ls.html) to return the paths as a vector.
These functions also take `glob` and `regexp` arguments, allowing you to filter paths by file type with globbing patterns (e.g. `*.csv`) or using a regular expression passed on to `grep()`.

```{r}
#| label: fs-view
fs::dir_tree("data")
fs::dir_ls("data")
```

If you're having regrets, or want to return your example project to its previous state, it's just as easy to `walk()` `fs::file_delete()` along those same paths.[^3]

```{r}
#| label: fs-delete
walk(paths, \(paths) fs::file_delete(paths))
```

## Saving multiple plots

Now, let's say you want to create and save a bunch of plots.
We'll use a modified version of the [`conditional_bars()`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#combining-with-other-tidyverse)[^4] function from the R for Data Science chapter on writing [functions](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html), and the built-in [diamonds](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) dataset.

```{r}
#| label: conditional-bars
# modified conditional bars function from R4DS
conditional_bars <- function(df, condition, var) {
  df |>
    filter({{ condition }}) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = {{ var }})) +
    geom_bar() +
    ggtitle(rlang::englue("Count of diamonds by {{var}} where {{condition}}"))
}
```

It's easy enough to run this for one condition, for example for the diamonds with `cut == "Good"`.

```{r}
#| label: goodclarity
#| fig-alt: "Bar chart showing count of diamonds by clarity in the diamonds dataset where the cut == Good."
diamonds |> conditional_bars(cut == "Good", clarity)
```

But what if we want to make a and save plot for each cut?
Again, it's `map()` and `walk()` to the rescue.

Because we're using the same data (`diamonds`) and conditioning on the same variable (`cut`), we'll only need to `map()` across the levels of `cut`, and can hard code the rest into the anonymous function.

```{r}
#| label: map-plots
# get the levels
cuts <- levels(diamonds$cut)

# make the plots
plots <- map(
  cuts,
  \(x) conditional_bars(
    df = diamonds,
    cut == {{ x }},
    clarity
    )
)
```

The plots are now saved in a list---a fine format for storing ggplots.
As we did when saving our CSVs, we'll use fs to create a directory to store them in, and make a vector of paths for file names.

```{r}
#| label: plot-paths
# make the folder to put them it (if exists, {fs} does nothing)
fs::dir_create("plots")
# make the file names
plot_paths <- str_glue("plots/{tolower(cuts)}_clarity.png")
```

Now we can use the paths and plots with `walk2()` to pass them as arguments to [`ggsave()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html).

```{r}
#| label: walk-plots
walk2(
  plot_paths,
  plots,
  \(path, plot) ggsave(path, plot, width = 6, height = 6)
)
```

Again, we can use fs to see what we've done:

```{r}
#| label: tree-plots
fs::dir_tree("plots")
```

And, clean up after ourselves if we didn't *really* want those plots after all.

```{r}
#| label: delete-plots
walk(plot_paths, \(paths) fs::file_delete(paths))
```
