We're chuffed to announce the release of [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org) 2.5.0. haven allows you to read and write SAS, SPSS, and Stata data formats from R, thanks to the wonderful [ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat) C library written by [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/).

You can install it from CRAN with:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html'>install.packages</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"haven"</span><span class='o'>)</span></code></pre>

</div>

The most important news for this release is that [Danny Smith](https://github.com/gorcha) is now a haven author in recognition of his significant and sustained contributions. He contributed the majority of improvements and bug fixes to this release.

Other improvements of note:

-   You can set custom variable widths when writing by setting the `width` attribute of the variable.

-   You can create FDA-compliant SAS transport files with haven, thanks to the addition of custom variable width support and some XPT writing related bug fixes.

-   `write_dta()` now supports Stata's `StrL` variables. This means that it's possible to write Stata files containing strings longer than 2045 characters, which was previously a hard upper limit.

You can see a full list of changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven/blob/main/NEWS.md).
