    When Spring comes around, it's time to emabark on some Spring
    Cleaning to take care of the package maintenance tasks 
    that you never seem to get around to. This post outlines
    the process and tools that the tidyverse team uses to make 
    this job fun and efficient.

As Spring arrives in the Northern hemisphere, the sun's rays reach into the corners and illuminate the dust that has been gathering over the dark winter. This is when our thoughts start to turn to Spring cleaning - a time to clear out the clutter that has accumulated over the past year. It represents a fresh start and a new beginning, and leaves us feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the rest of the year. This applies not only to our homes, but also to the code that we maintain - there are often bits and pieces that we know need attention but never seem to make it to the top of the priority list.

The tidyverse team at Posit has a practice of tackling Spring Cleaning together - we set aside a week to work in a semi-structured way to efficiently take care of a common list of package maintenance tasks. We find that setting a time for them and doing them all together during one week is an effective, and more fun, way to get them done. We recently completed our 2023 Spring Cleaning and thought it might be fun to share our process.

## Preparation

Early in the new year, we set aside the time in our calendars for Spring Cleaning - this way everyone knows that it's coming up and can make sure they have cleared the space in their schedules (and their minds) to focus on it.

We prepare for the week by creating a list of things we want to take care of in our packages. Rather than adding features or fixing bugs, these tasks are usually about bringing things up to current standards or best practices, and include things like updating tests to the latest testthat version, updating pkgdown templates, and adding alt-text to images in pkgdown sites. You can see some of the brainstorming that happened for this year's Spring cleaning in this [usethis issue](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1604). Not surprisingly, this year a lot of the upkeep was related to the recent rebrand from RStudio to Posit -- things like updating the copyright holder and author email addresses, and using updated logos with the old rstudio.com website on them.

We start off the week with a kickoff meeting on Monday morning. We go through the checklist with everybody and refine what's in it, making sure everybody has had input. Because we maintain so many packages, we have a spreadsheet where we keep track of the packages that are undergoing spring cleaning, and people can assign themselves to packages and mark them as completed when they're done.

## Checklists, checklists, checklists

We formalize these tasks into a checklist ([who doesn't love checklists](https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/)) via a function in usethis called `use_tidy_upkeep_issue()`. If you're a package developer and you use `use_release_issue()`, this will look familiar to you - it opens an issue in the package's GitHub repository with a checklist of tasks to guide you through what needs to be done. We update the function with the current year's checklist just prior to starting (and sometimes during) Spring Cleaning.

Package maintainers then install the development version of usethis to get the current checklist, and call `usethis::use_tidy_upkeep_issue()` in their project to create the issue. If there are any tasks that aren't relevant to that particular repo it's easy to just edit the issue and remove it. To be really meta, here is the 2023 Spring Cleaning upkeep issue for usethis, created by usethis:

[![](img/usethis-upkeep-issue.png)](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1791)

We separated the tasks into "Necessary" and "Optional". The necessary tasks were those we needed to complete for all of our packages, and also were simple enough that we could be sure we would able to complete them. The optional items were those that were nice to have, and/or would take longer to complete.

As always, the work to address the upkeep issues is submitted via [pull requests](https://github.com/tidymodels/dials/pull/275) - we try to complete the work, review, and merge all within the week with the intention of closing the upkeep issue by Friday. Any checklist items not completed in Spring Cleaning week are converted to their own issues (see the example in the above screenshot).

## Wrapup

Finally, we end the week with a wrap-up meeting - we do a retrospective on what worked, what didn't, and what we would change for next time. We also try to have a little fun! I made a small R package called [chatrbox](https://github.com/ateucher/chatrbox) that uses ChatGPT to generate R-themed Spring Cleaning related text. And Tracy Teal made us all certificates of achievement with inspirational messages made with quarto and chatrbox!

## Spring cleaning and you!

<!--# Edit/complete once https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/pull/1825 is complete -->

In the most recent version of usethis, we have created a general purpose `use_upkeep_issue()` function for package authors to use if they wish to do a Spring Cleaning of their own. It is a fairly opinionated list of tasks but we believe taking care of them will generally make your package better, easier to maintain, and more enjoyable for your users. Some of the tasks are meant to be performed only once (and once completed shouldn't show up in subsequent lists), and some should be reviewed periodically.

*[TBD if this feature is added] If you want to include additional tasks, you can add an (unexported) function `upkeep_bullets()` to your own package that returns a character vector. These will be added to your upkeep checklist.*

We hope that this might inspire you to take care of those nagging maintenance issues, whether it be in the Spring (whenever that is in your part of the world), or any other time. We'd love to hear if you find this helpful, or if there's a way that it could better, please [let us know](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis).
