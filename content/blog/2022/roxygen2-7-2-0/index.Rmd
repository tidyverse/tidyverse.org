We're tickled pink to announce the release of [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) 7.2.0.
roxygen2 allows you to write specially formatted R comments that generate R documentation files (`man/*.Rd`) and the `NAMESPACE` file.
roxygen2 is used by over 9,000 CRAN packages.

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

There are five big improvements in this release:

-   The `NAMESPACE` roclet now preserves all existing non-import directives during its first pass.
    This will generally eliminate the pair of `"NAMESPACE has changed"` messages and should reduce the chances that you end up with a sufficiently broken `NAMESPACE` that you can't re-load and re-document your package.

-   `@inheritParams` now only inherits exact multi-parameter matches.
    For example take `my_plot()` below:

    ```{r}
    #' @param width,height The dimensions in inches
    my_plot <- function(x, width, height) {
      
    }
    ```

    Previously, `width` and `height` were inherited individually, so this roxygen2 block:

    ```{r}
    #' @inheritParams my_plot
    your_plot <- function(x, y, width, height) {
      
    } 
    ```

    Would be equivalent to:

    ```{r}
    #' @param width The dimensions in inches
    #' @param height The dimensions in inches
    your_plot <- function(x, y, width, height) {
      
    } 
    ```

    Now, multi-parameter arguments will be inherited as a whole.
    This could potentially break your documentation if you (e.g.) only had one of `width` and `height` in your function.
    But we've only seen this problem a few places in the tidyverse, it was easily fixed, and inherited arguments are generally much improved.

-   We've done a thorough review of all warning messages to make them more informative and actionable.
    We've also fixed a number of bugs that led to invalid Rd files or pointed you to the wrong place.

    If you have a daily build of RStudio, warnings now include a clickable link that takes you directly to the problem.
    This technology is under active development across the IDE and the [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org) package and you can expect to see more of it in the future.
