We're chuffed to announce the release of [dbplyr](http://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) 2.3.0.
dbplyr is a database backend for dplyr that allows you to use a remote database as if it was a collection of local data frames: you write ordinary dplyr code and dbplyr translates it to SQL for you.

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("{package}")
```

This post will highlight some of the most important new features in 2.3.0: eliminating subqueries for many verb combinations, better errors, and a handful of new translations.
As usual, this release comes with a large number of improvements to translations for individual backends and you can see the full list in the [release notes](%7B%20github_release%20%7D)

```{r setup}
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

## SQL optimisation

dbplyr now produces fewer subqueries resulting in shorter, more readable, and, in some cases, faster SQL.
The following combinations of verbs no longer require subqueries:

-   `*_join()` + `select()` and `select()` + `*_join()`.
-   `mutate()` + `filter()` and `filter()` + `filter()`.
-   `select()`/`mutate()`/`filter()` + `distinct()`.
-   `summarise()` + `filter()` now translates to `HAVING`.
-   `left/inner_join()` + `left/inner_join()`.

Here are a couple of examples of queries that are now much more compact:

```{r}
lf1 <- lazy_frame(x = 1, a = "a", .name = "lf1")
lf2 <- lazy_frame(x = 1, b = "b", .name = "lf2")
lf3 <- lazy_frame(x = 1, c = "c", .name = "lf3")

lf1 |> 
  left_join(lf2, by = "x") |> 
  left_join(lf3, by = "x") |> 
  select(b, c)

lf1 |> 
  group_by(x) |> 
  summarise(a = mean(a, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) |> 
  filter(n > 5)
```

(As ususal in these blog posts, I'm using `lazy_frame()` to focus on the SQL generation, without having to set up a dummy database.)

Additionally, where possible, dbplyr now uses `SELECT *` after a join instead of explicitly selecting every column.

## Improved errors

Variables that aren't found in either the data or in the environment now produce an error:

```{r}
#| error: true
lf <- lazy_frame(x = 1,y = 2)

lf |> mutate(x = z + 1)
```

(Previously they were silently translated to SQL variables.)

We've also generally reviewed the error messages to ensure they show more clearly where the error happened:

```{r}
#| error: true
lf |> mutate(x = y %/% 1)

lf |> mutate(across(x:y, "a"))
```

## New translations

`stringr::str_like()` (new in stringr 1.5.0) is translated to `LIKE`:

```{r}
lf1 |> 
  filter(stringr::str_like(a, "abc"))
```

dbplyr 2.3.0 is also supports features coming in [dplyr 1.1.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/11/dplyr-1-1-0-is-coming-soon/):

-   The `.by` argument is supported as alternative to `group_by()`.
-   Passing `...` to `across()` is deprecated because the evaluation timing of `...` is ambiguous.
-   New `pick()` and `case_match()` functions are translated.
-   `case_when()` now supports the `.default` argument.

This version does not support the new `join_by()` syntax, but we're working on it, and we'll release an update after dplyr 1.1.0 is out.
