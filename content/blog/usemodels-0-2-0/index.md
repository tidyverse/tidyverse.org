We're chuffed to announce the release of the  [usemodels](https://usemodels.tidymodels.org/) package. usemodels enables users to generate tidymodels templates for fitting and tuning models. 

You can install it from CRAN with:


```r
install.packages("usemodels")
```

This blog post will describe the new features.

You can see a full list of changes in the [release notes](https://usemodels.tidymodels.org/news/index.html)


```r
library(usemodels)
```

## Clipboard access

Each of the `use_*()` functions has a `clipboard` feature that will send to new code to the clipboard instead of writing to the console window. 


```r
use_cubist(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars, clipboard = TRUE)
```

```
## âœ“ code is on the clipboard.
```

## New Models

As requested in GitHub issues, [C5.0](https://www.rulequest.com/see5-unix.html) and [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) model templates were added. For example, SVM models require centering and scaling of the predictors: 


```r
data(two_class_dat, package = "modeldata")
use_kernlab_svm_rbf(Class ~ ., data = two_class_dat)
```

```
## kernlab_recipe <- 
##   recipe(formula = Class ~ ., data = two_class_dat) %>% 
##   step_zv(all_predictors()) %>% 
##   step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) 
## 
## kernlab_spec <- 
##   svm_rbf(cost = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune()) %>% 
##   set_mode("classification") 
## 
## kernlab_workflow <- 
##   workflow() %>% 
##   add_recipe(kernlab_recipe) %>% 
##   add_model(kernlab_spec) 
## 
## set.seed(98547)
## kernlab_tune <-
##   tune_grid(kernlab_workflow, resamples = stop("add your rsample object"), grid = stop("add number of candidate points"))
```

Let us know if there are other features that would be interesting for the package on its GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/tidymodels/usemodels/issues).
