Another year, another roundup of tidyverse updates, through the lens of an educator. As with previous [teaching the tidyverse posts](/blog/2021/08/teach-tidyverse-2021/), much of what is discussed in this blog post has already been covered in package update posts, however the goal of this roundup is to summarize the highlights that are most relevant to teaching data science with the tidyverse, particularly to new learners.

Specifically, I'll discuss: **TO DO: UPDATE OUTLINE**

-   [Nine core packages in tidyverse 2.0.0](#new-teaching-and-learning-resources)

Throughout this blog post you'll encounter some code chunks with the comment `previously`, indicating what you used to do in the tidyverse. Often these will be coupled with chunks with the comment `now, optionally`, indicating what you *can* now do with the tidyverse. And rarely, they will be coupled with chunks with the comment `now`, indicating what you *should* do instead now with the tidyverse.

Let's get started with the obligatory...

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

And, let's also load the **palmerpenguins** package that we will use in examples.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Nine core packages in tidyverse 2.0.0

The main update in tidyverse 2.0.0, which was released in March 2023, is that it **lubridate** is now a core tidyverse package. The lubridate package that makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times, is now a core tidyverse package. So, while many of your scripts in the past may have started with

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

you can now just do

```{r}
#| eval: false

# now
library(tidyverse)
```

and the lubridate package will be loaded as well.

If you, like me, use a graphic like the one below that maps the core tidyverse packages to phases of the data science cycle, here is an updated graphic including lubridate.

![](images/data-science.png){fig-alt="Data science cycle: import, tidy, transform, visualize, model, communicate. Packages readr and tibble are for import. Packages tidyr and purr for tidy and transform. Packages dplyr, stringr, forcats, and lubridate are for transform. Package ggplot2 is for visualize."}

Additionally, the package loading message for the tidyverse now advertises the **conflicted** package.

```{r}
#| echo: false

tidyverse_conflicts()
```

Conflict resolution in R, i.e., what to do if multiple packages that are loaded in a session have functions with the same name, can get tricky, and the conflicted package is designed to help with that. R's default conflict resolution gives precedence to the most recently loaded package. For example, if you use the filter function before loading the tidyverse, R will use `stats::filter()`:

```{r}
#| include: false

devtools::unload("dplyr")
```

```{r}
#| error: true

penguins |>
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

However, after loading the tidyverse, when you call `filter()`, R will *silently* choose `dplyr::filter()`:

```{r}
#| include: false

library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

This silent conflict resolution approach works fine until it doesn't, and then it can be very frustrating to debug. The conflicted package does not allow for silent conflict resolution:

```{r}
#| error: true
 
library(conflicted)
    
penguins |>
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

You can, of course, use `dplyr::filter()` but if you have a bunch of data wrangling pipelines, which is likely the case if you're teaching data wrangling, it can get pretty busy.

Instead, with conflicted, you can explicitly declare which `filter()` you want to use at the beginning (of a session, of a script, or of an R Markdown or Quarto file) with `conflicts_prefer()`:

```{r}
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
  
penguins |>
  filter(species == "Adelie")
```

Getting back to the package loading message... It can be tempting, particularly in a teaching scenario, particularly to an audience of new learners, and particularly if you teach with slides and messages take up valuable slide real estate, I would urge you to not hide startup messages from teaching materials. Instead, address them early on to:

1.  Encourage reading and understanding messages, warnings, and errors -- teaching people to read error messages is hard enough, it's going to be even harder if you're not modeling that to them.

2.  Help during hard-to-debug situations resulting from base R's silent conflict resolution -- because, let's face it, someone in your class, if not you during a live-coding session, will see that pesky object not found error at some point when using `filter()`.

## Improved and expanded `*_join()` functionality

The **dplyr** package has long had the `*_join()` family of functions for joining data frames.

### `join_by()`

New functionality for join functions includes a new `join_by()` function for the `by` argument. So, while in the past your code may have looked like the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
x |>
  *_join(
    y, 
    by = c("<x var>" = "<y var>")
  )
```

you can now do:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# now, optionally
x |>
  *_join(
    y, 
    by = join_by(<x var> == <y var>)
  )
```

For example, suppose you have the following information on the three islands we have penguins from:

```{r}
islands <- tribble(
  ~name,       ~coordinates,
  "Torgersen", "64°46′S 64°5′W",
  "Biscoe",    "65°26′S 65°30′W",
  "Dream",     "64°44′S 64°14′W"
)

islands
```

You can join this to the penguins data frame by matching the `island` column in the penguins data frame to the `name` column in the islands data frame:

```{r}
penguins |>
  left_join(
    islands, 
    by = join_by(island == name)
  ) |>
  select(species, island, coordinates)
```

While `by = c("island" = "name")` would still work, I would recommend teaching `join_by()` over `by` so that:

1.  You can read it out loud as "where x is equal to y", just like in other logical statements where `==` is pronounced as "is equal to".
2.  You don't have to worry about `by = c(x = y)` (which is invalid) vs. `by = c(x = "y")` (which is valid) vs. `by = c("x" = "y")` (which is also valid).

### Handling various matches

The `*_join()` functions now have additional arguments for handling `multiple` matches and `unmatched` rows as well as for specifying the `relationship` between the two data frames.

So, while in the past your code may have looked like the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
*_join(
  x,
  y,
  by
)
```

you can now do:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# now, optionally
*_join(
  x,
  y,
  by,
  multiple = "all",
  unmatched = "drop",
  relationship = NULL
)
```

Let's set up three data frames to demonstrate the new functionality:

1.  Information about three penguins, one row per `samp_id`:

```{r}
three_penguins <- tribble(
  ~samp_id, ~species,    ~island,
  1,        "Adelie",    "Torgersen",
  2,        "Gentoo",    "Biscoe",
  3,        "Chinstrap", "Dream"
)

three_penguins
```

2.  Information about weight measurements of these penguins, one row per `samp_id`, `meas_id` combination:

```{r}
weight_measurements <- tribble(
  ~samp_id, ~meas_id, ~body_mass_g,
  1,        1,        3220,
  1,        2,        3250,
  2,        1,        4730,
  2,        2,        4725,
  3,        1,        4000,
  3,        2,        4050
)

weight_measurements
```

3.  Information about flipper measurements of these penguins, one row per `samp_id`, `meas_id` combination:

```{r}
flipper_measurements <- tribble(
  ~samp_id, ~meas_id, ~flipper_length_mm,
  1,        1,        193,
  1,        2,        195,
  2,        1,        214,
  2,        2,        216,
  3,        1,        203,
  3,        2,        203
)

flipper_measurements
```

One-to-many relationships don't require extra care, they just work:

```{r}
three_penguins |>
  left_join(weight_measurements, join_by(samp_id))
```

However, many-to-many relationships require some extra care. For example, if we join the `three_penguins` data frame to the `flipper_measurements` data frame, we get a warning:

```{r}
three_penguins |>
  left_join(flipper_measurements, join_by(samp_id))
```

We get a warning about unexpected many-to-many relationships (unexpected because we didn't specify this type of relationship in our join call), and the warning suggests setting `relationship = "many-to-many"`. And note that we went from 6 rows (measurements) to 12, which is also unexpected.

```{r}
weight_measurements |>
  left_join(flipper_measurements, join_by(samp_id), relationship = "many-to-many")
```

With `relationship = "many-to-many"`, we no longer get a warning. However, the "explosion of rows" issue is still there. Addressing that requires rethinking what we join the two data frames by:

```{r}
weight_measurements |>
  left_join(flipper_measurements, join_by(samp_id, meas_id))
```

We can see that while the warning nudged us towards setting `relationship = "many-to-many"`, turns out the correct way to address the problem was to join by both `samp_id` and `meas_id`.

We'll wrap up our discussion on new functionality for handling `unmatched` cases. We'll create one more data frame (`four_penguins`) to exemplify this:

```{r}
four_penguins <- tribble(
  ~samp_id, ~species,    ~island,
  1,        "Adelie",    "Torgersen",
  2,        "Gentoo",    "Biscoe",
  3,        "Chinstrap", "Dream",
  4,        "Adelie",    "Biscoe"
)

four_penguins
```

If we just join `weight_measurements` to `four_penguins`, the unmatched fourth penguin silently disappears, which is less than ideal, particularly in a more realistic scenario with many more observations:

```{r}
weight_measurements |>
  left_join(four_penguins, join_by(samp_id))
```

Setting `unmatched = "error"` can protects you from accidentally dropping rows:

```{r}
#| error: true

weight_measurements |>
  left_join(four_penguins, join_by(samp_id), unmatched = "error")
```

Once you see the error message, you can decide how to handle the unmatched rows, e.g., explicitly drop them.

```{r}
weight_measurements |>
  left_join(four_penguins, join_by(samp_id), unmatched = "drop")
```

There are many more developments related to `*_join()` functions (e.g., [inequality joins](/blog/2023/01/dplyr-1-1-0-joins/#inequality-joins) and [rolling joins](/blog/2023/01/dplyr-1-1-0-joins/#rolling-joins)), but many of these likely wouldn't come up in an introductory course so we won't get into their details. A good place to read more about them is [R for Data Science, 2nd edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/joins.html#sec-non-equi-joins).

Exploding joins (i.e., joins that result in a larger number of rows than either of the data frames from bie) can be hard to debug for students! Teaching them the tools to diagnose whether the join they performed, and that may not have given an error, is indeed the one they wanted to perform. Did they lose any cases? Did they gain an unexpected amount of cases? Did they perform a join without thinking and take down the entire teaching server? These things happen, particularly if students are working with their own data for an open-ended project!

## Per operation grouping

previously

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
df |>
  group_by(x) |>
  summarize(mean(y))
```

now, optionally

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
df |>
  summarize(
    mean(y), 
    .by = x
  )
```

Persistent groups:

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex, body_mass_g) |>
  group_by(species, sex) |>
  summarize(mean_bw = mean(body_mass_g)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

Dropped groups:

```{r}
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex, body_mass_g) |>
  group_by(species, sex) |>
  summarize(mean_bw = mean(body_mass_g), .groups = "drop") |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

Per operation grouping:

```{r}
# group by 1 variable
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex, body_mass_g) |>
  summarize(
    mean_bw = mean(body_mass_g), 
    .by = species
  )

# group by 2 variables
penguins |>
  drop_na(sex, body_mass_g) |>
  summarize(
    mean_bw = mean(body_mass_g), 
    .by = c(species, sex)
  )
```

Teaching tip: Choose one grouping method and stick to it

It doesn't matter whether you use group_by() (followed by .groups, where needed) or .by.

For new learners, pick one and stick to it. For more experienced learners, particularly those learning to design their own functions and packages, it can be interesting to go through the differences and evolution.

## Quality of life improvements to `case_when()` and `if_else()`

### `case_when()`

all else denoted by .default for case_when() less strict about value type for both

previously

```{r}
#| eval: false

# previously
df |>
  mutate(
    x = case_when(
      <condition 1> ~ "value 1",
      <condition 2> ~ "value 2",
      <condition 3> ~ "value 3",
      TRUE          ~ NA_character_
    )
  )
```

now, optionally

```{r}
#| eval: false

# now, optionally
df |>
  mutate(
    x = case_when(
      <condition 1> ~ "value 1",
      <condition 2> ~ "value 2",
      <condition 3> ~ "value 3",
      .default = NA
    )
  )
```

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(
    bm_cat = case_when(
      is.na(body_mass_g) ~ NA,
      body_mass_g < 3550 ~ "Small",
      between(body_mass_g, 3550, 4750) ~ "Medium",
      .default = "Large"
    )
  ) |>
  relocate(body_mass_g, bm_cat)
```

### if_else()

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(
    bm_unit = if_else(!is.na(body_mass_g), paste(body_mass_g, "g"), NA)
  ) |>
  relocate(body_mass_g, bm_unit)
```

Teaching tip: It's a blessing to not have to introduce NA_character\_ and friends

Especially not having to introduce it as early as if_else() and case_when(). Cherish it!

Different types of NAs are a good topic for a course on R as a programming language, statistical computing, etc. but not necessary for an intro course.

## New syntax for separating columns

that supersede [`extract()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/extract.html), [`separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html), and [`separate_rows()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate_rows.html) because they have more consistent names and arguments, have better performance, and provide a new approach for handling problems:

|                                  | **MAKE COLUMNS**                                                                               | **MAKE ROWS**                                                                                    |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separate with delimiter          | [`separate_wider_delim()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate_wider_delim.html)    | [`separate_longer_delim()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate_longer_delim.html)    |
| Separate by position             | [`separate_wider_position()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate_wider_delim.html) | [`separate_longer_position()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate_longer_delim.html) |
| Separate with regular expression |                                                                                                |                                                                                                  |
