## Which versions of R do tidyverse packages support? 

Though package-specific minimum versions of R are given in the `Depends` fields of individual `DESCRIPTION` files, our general policy is to support the __current version__, the __devel version__, and __four previous versions__ of R.

**Edit 2022-11-15[^1]**

Over the past several years and moving forward (as described in the “Release plans” section of the [R Developer Page](https://developer.r-project.org/)), R version releases occur annually:

> The overall release schedule is to have annual x.y.0 releases in Spring, with patch releases happening on an as-needed basis.

Thus, the _official_ minimum supported versions of R for the tidyverse[^2] are as described in the table, below.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# make r version tibble
rversions <- tibble::tribble(
  ~year, ~r_release,
  2013L, "3.0",
  2014L, "3.1",
  2015L, "3.2",
  2016L, "3.3",
  2017L, "3.4",
  2018L, "3.5",
  2019L, "3.6",
  2020L, "4.0",
  2021L, "4.1",
  2022L, "4.2",
  2023L, "4.3",
  2024L, "4.4",
  2025L, "4.5",
  2026L, "4.6"
)

# get year for projected
cur_year <- lubridate::year(lubridate::today())
# make table
rversions_filtered <- rversions |>
  dplyr::arrange(year) |>
  dplyr::mutate("min_version" = dplyr::lag(r_release, n = 4L, order_by = year)) |>
  dplyr::select(c(year, r_release, min_version)) |>
  dplyr::filter(year >= 2019)

new_names <- c("Year", "Current R version", "Minimum supported version")

knitr::kable(rversions_filtered,
  col.names = new_names,
  caption = "Tidyverse minimum R version support"
)
```


[^1]: Add table with annual historic and projected R-version support.
[^2]: Note that older versions _may_ be supported. For example, as of 2022, the [tidyverse package `Depends` field](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/blob/aeabcde8c6ae435f16b5173682d5667d292829fb/DESCRIPTION#LL17-L18) is R (>= 3.3).
