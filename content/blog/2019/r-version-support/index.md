Our general policy is to support the **current version**, the **devel version**, and **four previous versions** of R. This policy applies to all packages that we support, i.e. as well as all tidyverse packages, it also applies to the infrastructure packages that we maintain in [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib).

Thus the *official* minimum supported versions of R for the tidyverse are as follows:

| R version | Release date  | Minimum supported version |
|:--------- |:--------------|:--------------------------|
| 3.6       | 2019-04-26    | 3.2                       |
| 4.0       | 2020-04-24    | 3.3                       |
| 4.1       | 2021-05-18    | 3.4                       |
| 4.2       | 2022-04-22    | 3.5                       |
| 4.3       | 2023-04-21    | 3.6                       |
| 4.4       | 2024-04-24    | 4.0                       |
| 4.5       | 2025 Spring   | 4.1                       |
| 4.6       | 2026 Spring   | 4.2                       |

Note that, as described in the R Developer ["Release plans"](https://developer.r-project.org/), R version releases occur annually in Spring. We generally update the required version in package metadata on the next package release after the R release, so you may see older versions listed in published CRAN packages.

### Edit history

* 2022-11-15: Added table with annual historic and projected R-version support.
* 2024-07-03: Clarified that the policy also applies to r-lib and added release dates.
