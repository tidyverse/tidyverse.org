<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post is a demo of <code>callr::r_session</code>, a persistent R session you can
use to run R code asynchronously. I set out to build a task queue, which
runs tasks in subprocesses, concurrently, in a mere 100 lines of R code.</p>
<p>Here is a short teaser for how the queue will work. <code>task_q$new()</code> creates
a new R6 object, which represents the queue. Its <code>push()</code> method adds a
task, which is a function and its arguments, similar to <code>callr::r()</code>.
The <code>pop()</code> method gets the results of the first task that has finished.
<code>pop()</code> has a timeout argument, which lets you wait for a task to finish,
if all pushed tasks are still running. It returns <code>NULL</code> if no task has
finished before the timeout was over. The timeout can be <code>0</code> or <code>Inf</code>,
meaning no wait at all, or wait indefinitely. The default timeout is <code>0</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q &lt;- task_q$new()
q$push(function() { Sys.getpid() })
q$push(function() { Sys.sleep(.5); Sys.getpid() })
q$pop()
#&gt; NULL</code></pre>
<p>This <code>pop()</code> call returned <code>NULL</code>, as none of the tasks are done yet.
Even though running <code>Sys.getpid()</code> is fast, the worker processes also need
200-500 ms time start up, when the queue is created. If you are willing to
wait a bit, at least one task should be done in less than half a second
(500 ms), but usually not the second one yet:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$pop(500)$result
#&gt; [1] 18383
q$pop()
#&gt; NULL</code></pre>
<p>The <code>poll()</code> method checks for finished tasks without removing their
results from the queue. It also has a timeout parameter, which works the
same way as <code>pop()</code>’s timeout. <code>poll()</code> returns the identifiers of all
tasks that are done.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$poll(Inf)
#&gt; [1] &quot;.2&quot;
q$pop()$result
#&gt; [1] 18385</code></pre>
<p>If the queue is empty, i.e. no tasks are running and no tasks are waiting,
then <code>pop()</code> always returns <code>NULL</code>, immediately, because there is nothing
to wait for:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$pop()
#&gt; NULL</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="api-design" class="section level2">
<h2>API design</h2>
<p>The task queue will be an R6 class, with <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, <code>poll()</code>
methods like above, and some other query methods:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>task_q &lt;- R6::R6Class(
  &quot;task_q&quot;,
  public = list(
    initialize      = function(num_workers = 4L) { },
    get_num_waiting = function() { },
    get_num_running = function() { },
    get_num_done    = function() { },
    is_idle         = function() { },
    list_tasks      = function() { },

    push = function(fun, args = list(), id = NULL) { },
    poll = function(timeout = 0) { },
    pop = function(timeout = 0) { }
  )
)</code></pre>
<p><code>initialize()</code> has an argument to set the number of workers. The size of
the worker pool remains fixed for the lifetime of the queue.</p>
<p>The <code>get_num_*()</code> methods return the number of waiting, running and
completed tasks. <code>get_num_done()</code> includes tasks that haven’t been
<code>pop()</code>-d yet. Once a task is <code>pop()</code>-d, it is removed completely from the
queue.</p>
<p><code>is_idle()</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> if the queue does not have any tasks (in any
state). <code>list_tasks()</code> returns a data frame (tibble) with data about the
tasks. This is especially useful for debugging.</p>
<p><code>push()</code> adds a task to the queue. <code>poll()</code> returns the ids of all tasks
that are done. <code>pop()</code> returns the result of the oldest task that is done.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Data structure</h2>
<p>Before writing the methods, I’ll design the data structure that will
store all information about the tasks and the worker processes. The
standard data structure for a list of records is a data frame in R.</p>
<p>A logical choice would be to have two data frames, one for the
tasks, and another one for the workers. Then we could assign unique
identifiers to both tasks and processes and cross-reference them in the
two data frames, to mark which task a worker is running, and which worker
a task is running on.</p>
<p>I’ll go a step further here, and store both the tasks and the workers
<em>in the same</em> data frame. This will simplify the implementation
considerably. The queue will create a dummy <em>idle</em> task for each worker.
Each worker will (pretend to) run its dummy task if there are no other,
real tasks waiting in the queue. So the task list will always contain at
least as many tasks as the number of workers in the queue.</p>
<p>An example for a task data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$list_tasks()
#&gt; # A tibble: 9 x 7
#&gt;   id      idle  state   fun    args       worker     result
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt;     &lt;list&gt;     &lt;list&gt;
#&gt; 1 .11     FALSE running &lt;fn&gt;   &lt;list [1]&gt; &lt;r_sessin&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 2 .12     FALSE running &lt;fn&gt;   &lt;list [1]&gt; &lt;r_sessin&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 3 .13     FALSE running &lt;fn&gt;   &lt;list [1]&gt; &lt;r_sessin&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 4 .14     FALSE running &lt;fn&gt;   &lt;list [1]&gt; &lt;r_sessin&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 5 .15     FALSE waiting &lt;fn&gt;   &lt;list [1]&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 6 .idle-1 TRUE  waiting &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 7 .idle-2 TRUE  waiting &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 8 .idle-3 TRUE  waiting &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;
#&gt; 9 .idle-4 TRUE  waiting &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;     &lt;NULL&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The columns are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: a character id, which can be user-supplied or auto-assigned (if the
user did not supply it). This is useful to identify tasks.</li>
<li><code>idle</code>: a logical flag, whether this is a dummy idle task or not.</li>
<li><code>state</code>: current state of the task. More about this shortly.</li>
<li><code>fun</code>: the function the task needs to run. This is a list column.</li>
<li><code>args</code>: arguments to pass to the function. This is a list itself,
so the column is a list column.</li>
<li><code>worker</code>: the <code>callr::r_session</code> object, the R session that is running
the task, or <code>NULL</code> if the task is not running.</li>
<li><code>result</code>: another list column, the result of the run, if the task is
already done, <code>NULL</code> otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possible task states are: <em>waiting</em>, <em>running</em>, <em>ready</em> and <em>done</em>.
The first two are not very surprising. The distinction between the
last two is somewhat technical. A task is <em>ready</em> if the background R
session has finished running it. The queue hasn’t read out its result yet,
and the R session is still assigned to it. (I.e. the task’s <code>worker</code> column
is not <code>NULL</code>.) A task is <em>done</em> if the queue has already read out the
result of the function call, and has reassigned the R session to another
task, so its <code>worker</code> column is <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>Tasks that are <em>running</em> and <em>ready</em> always have an R session assigned to
them. Since all R sessions are always assigned to tasks (dummy idle tasks,
if there is nothing else), this means the that the sum of the <em>running</em>
and <em>ready</em> tasks always equals the number of workers.</p>
<p>The idle tasks are somewhat special, because they are never <em>done</em>. If
an idle task is <em>ready</em> and its worker is reassigned, it will be <em>waiting</em>
again. They are also almost never in the <em>running</em> state. When the queue
assigns a worker to an idle task, the task will immediately go into the
<em>ready</em> state, since the queue is immediately allowed to re-assign the
worker, should a real task be <em>waiting</em>.</p>
<p>However, when a worker is starting up, its idle task is <em>running</em>, until
their background R process has started up. After this initial <em>running</em>
state the idle tasks are always either <em>waiting</em> or <em>ready</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level2">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>I am ready to start the implementation now. I’ll focus on the individual
methods here, and show the complete code of the R6 class at the end.
Let’s start with the internal data. <code>tasks</code> contains the task data frame,
<code>initialize()</code> will create it. <code>next_id</code> and <code>get_next_id</code> will provide
us unique task ids. I prefix these with a dot, to increase the probability
that they won’t interfere with user supplied task ids. So they’ll
be <code>&quot;.1&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;.2&quot;</code>, etc.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  private = list(
    tasks = NULL,
    next_id = 1L,
    get_next_id = function() {
      id &lt;- private$next_id
      private$next_id &lt;- id + 1L
      paste0(&quot;.&quot;, id)
    }
  )</code></pre>
<p>The <code>initialize()</code> method will just defer the work to a private method.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    initialize = function(num_workers = 4L) {
      private$start_workers(num_workers)
      invisible(self)
    }</code></pre>
<p>The private <code>start_workers()</code> method that actually starts the
workers and creates the <code>tasks</code> data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    start_workers = function(num_workers) {
      private$tasks &lt;- tibble::tibble(
        id = character(), idle = logical(),
        state = c(&quot;waiting&quot;, &quot;running&quot;, &quot;ready&quot;, &quot;done&quot;)[0],
        fun = list(), args = list(), worker = list(), result = list())
      for (i in seq_len(num_workers)) {
        rs &lt;- callr::r_session$new(wait = FALSE)
        private$tasks &lt;- tibble::add_row(private$tasks,
          id = paste0(&quot;.idle-&quot;, i), idle = TRUE, state = &quot;running&quot;,
          fun = list(NULL), args = list(NULL), worker = list(rs),
          result = list(NULL))
      }
    }</code></pre>
<p>The starting values of the empty task data frame are mostly straightforward.
If you are wondering about the indexing with zero here, it is a simple
way to list all possible task states in the code, in one place, as a note
for the code reader.</p>
<p><code>callr::r_session$new()</code> starts a background R process. The <code>wait = FALSE</code>
argument tells callr <em>not</em> to wait until the process is ready to run R
code. This way the R processes start up in parallel, which is worth the
trouble of making our dummy tasks a bit more complicated. The idle tasks
are named <code>.idle-*</code>. After initialization, the workers are started, and
the <em>running</em> idle tasks are added to the data frame.</p>
<p>The query methods are next:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    list_tasks = function() private$tasks,
    get_num_waiting = function()
      sum(!private$tasks$idle &amp; private$tasks$state == &quot;waiting&quot;),
    get_num_running = function() sum(private$tasks$state == &quot;running&quot;),
    get_num_done = function() sum(private$tasks$state == &quot;done&quot;),
    is_idle = function() sum(!private$tasks$idle) == 0
</code></pre>
<p><code>list_tasks()</code> will just return the task data frame, for simplicity.
If not all data is needed, the <code>get_num_*()</code> functions are simpler.
For the first two, we need to exclude the dummy idle tasks, because they
can be in the <em>waiting</em> and <em>running</em> state as well. They cannot be in the
<em>done</em> state.</p>
<p>We still need to write the <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code> and <code>poll()</code> public methods.
As the reader might suspect, these are more involved. Let’s start with
<code>push()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    push = function(fun, args = list(), id = NULL) {
      if (is.null(id)) id &lt;- private$get_next_id()
      if (id %in% private$tasks$id) stop(&quot;Duplicate task id&quot;)
      before &lt;- which(private$tasks$idle)[1]
      private$tasks &lt;- tibble::add_row(private$tasks, .before = before,
        id = id, idle = FALSE, state = &quot;waiting&quot;, fun = list(fun),
        args = list(args), worker = list(NULL), result = list(NULL))
      private$schedule()
      invisible(id)
    }</code></pre>
<p>The queue needs to run the tasks in the same order as they were added.
The data frame will keep the correct order, with the additional
tweak that the idle tasks are always at the end. Indeed, these should only
run if there is no other task waiting. So <code>push()</code> adds the new task right
before the idle tasks.</p>
<p>The <code>schedule()</code> private method is the core of the queue. It starts the
tasks on the selected background R workers, and it also reads out the
results after they are done. I.e. it performs the <em>waiting</em> to <em>running</em> and
<em>ready</em> to <em>done</em> task state transitions. We will show it later.</p>
<p><code>push()</code> returns the id of the newly added task, this can be helpful
to follow the task and match it to the results of a <code>pop()</code> call.</p>
<p><code>pop()</code> uses <code>poll()</code> to get a list of tasks that are <em>done</em>, and returns
the result of the oldest one, which is always the first, thanks to the
ordering of the task data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    pop = function(timeout = 0) {
      if (is.na(done &lt;- self$poll(timeout)[1])) return(NULL)
      row &lt;- match(done, private$tasks$id)
      result &lt;- private$tasks$result[[row]]
      private$tasks &lt;- private$tasks[-row, ]
      c(result, list(task_id = done))
    }</code></pre>
<p>If no task is <em>done</em>, then it returns <code>NULL</code>. The returned task is removed
from the task data frame, and from the queue in general, for good. <code>pop()</code>
adds the id of the task to the returned result as <code>task_id</code>, for easier
matching of tasks to results.</p>
<p><code>poll()</code> is the only method that checks on the running workers. This is
important to remember, and unfortunately easy to forget. If the user does
not call <code>poll()</code>, either directly or via <code>pop()</code>, the state of a <em>running</em>
task cannot change, even if the background R session itself has finished.
In other words, one cannot check the status of the tasks by listing
the task data frame with <code>list_tasks()</code> periodically. This will never
change if <code>poll()</code> is not called.</p>
<p>I start with an initial version of <code>poll()</code>, which will need changes later,
but this is hopefully easier to understand first:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    poll = function(timeout = 0) {
      as_ms &lt;- function(x) if (x == Inf) -1L else as.integer(x)
      topoll &lt;- which(private$tasks$state == &quot;running&quot;)
      conns &lt;- lapply(
        private$tasks$worker[topoll],
        function(x) x$get_poll_connection())
      pr &lt;- processx::poll(conns, as_ms(timeout))
      private$tasks$state[topoll][pr == &quot;ready&quot;] &lt;- &quot;ready&quot;
      private$schedule()
      private$tasks$id[private$tasks$state == &quot;done&quot;]
    }</code></pre>
<p>We only need to check on tasks that are <em>running</em>. <code>poll()</code> uses the
<code>processx::poll()</code> function that can wait on several <code>callr::r_session</code>s
at once. More precisely, I extract the <em>poll connections</em> of the
<code>r_session</code> objects and call <code>processx::poll()</code> on these. An <code>r_session</code>
may have multiple pollable connections, one for its standard output
stream, one for its standard error stream. These are not used by default
in <code>r_session</code>s, and I only want to check on the poll connection, which
signals if the R session has finished with the computation (or encountered
an error while working on it). <code>processx::poll()</code> returns a list of
character vectors, one entry for each (<em>running</em>) task. This is <code>&quot;ready&quot;</code>
if the session is ready with the task. (Or it is <code>&quot;silent&quot;</code> if it is not
ready, or <code>&quot;timeout&quot;</code> if the time limit expired and no workers are ready.)</p>
<p>All tasks that returned <code>&quot;ready&quot;</code> are indeed set to the <em>ready</em> state.
After this <code>poll()</code> calls <code>schedule()</code> to read out the results of the
<em>ready</em> tasks and reassign their workers to <em>waiting</em> ones.</p>
<p><code>poll()</code> returns the ids of all tasks that are <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>This version of <code>poll()</code> has a small issue when the R sessions are starting
up: it might return without any results, before the specified timeout
value is over. At startup the idle tasks are <em>running,</em> and they are
polled by <code>processx::poll()</code>. If any of the R sessions start up before the
timeout is over, <code>processx::poll()</code> returns with <code>&quot;ready&quot;</code> for them.
But <code>schedule()</code> cannot mark these tasks as <em>done</em>, because they are idle
tasks, they’ll be <em>waiting</em>, and with no task <em>done</em>, <code>poll()</code>
will return an empty vector. This is problematic, because <code>poll()</code>
promises to either wait until the specified timeout <em>or</em> return a task
that is <em>done</em>. So we need to wrap the simplified <code>poll()</code> into a loop, and
keep calling <code>processx::poll()</code> until either the timeout
expires or a task is <em>done</em>. The final <code>poll()</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    poll = function(timeout = 0) {
      limit &lt;- Sys.time() + timeout
      as_ms &lt;- function(x) if (x == Inf) -1L else as.integer(x)
      repeat{
        topoll &lt;- which(private$tasks$state == &quot;running&quot;)
        conns &lt;- lapply(
          private$tasks$worker[topoll],
          function(x) x$get_poll_connection())
        pr &lt;- processx::poll(conns, as_ms(timeout))
        private$tasks$state[topoll][pr == &quot;ready&quot;] &lt;- &quot;ready&quot;
        private$schedule()
        ret &lt;- private$tasks$id[private$tasks$state == &quot;done&quot;]
        if (is.finite(timeout)) timeout &lt;- limit - Sys.time()
        if (length(ret) || timeout &lt; 0) break;
      }
      ret
    }</code></pre>
<p>Only the private <code>schedule()</code> method is missing now:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>    schedule = function() {
      ready &lt;- which(private$tasks$state == &quot;ready&quot;)
      if (!length(ready)) return()
      rss &lt;- private$tasks$worker[ready]

      private$tasks$result[ready] &lt;- lapply(rss, function(x) x$read())
      private$tasks$worker[ready] &lt;- replicate(length(ready), NULL)
      private$tasks$state[ready] &lt;-
        ifelse(private$tasks$idle[ready], &quot;waiting&quot;, &quot;done&quot;)

      waiting &lt;- which(private$tasks$state == &quot;waiting&quot;)[1:length(ready)]
      private$tasks$worker[waiting] &lt;- rss
      private$tasks$state[waiting] &lt;-
        ifelse(private$tasks$idle[waiting], &quot;ready&quot;, &quot;running&quot;)
      lapply(waiting, function(i) {
        if (! private$tasks$idle[i]) {
          private$tasks$worker[[i]]$call(private$tasks$fun[[i]],
                                         private$tasks$args[[i]])
        }
      })
    }</code></pre>
<p><code>schedule()</code>’s job is to perform the <em>ready</em> to <em>done</em> and the
<em>waiting</em> to <em>running</em> state transitions. The first involves reading
out the results of the <em>ready</em> tasks and the second involves starting
new computation on the workers.</p>
<p>For every <em>ready</em> task, <code>schedule()</code> perform three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reads out and stores its result. (It can do this for the idle tasks
as well, for these <code>r_session$read()</code> will return <code>NULL</code>.)</li>
<li>Removes its worker, i.e. sets it to <code>NULL</code>.</li>
<li>Updates its state to <em>done</em>. (Or to <em>waiting</em> if it is an idle task.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then it deals with the <em>waiting</em> tasks, but not more than the number of
<em>ready</em> tasks the queue had. For these <em>waiting</em> tasks <code>schedule()</code>
performs three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Assigns a just removed worker to it.</li>
<li>Sets state to <em>running</em>. (Or to <em>ready</em> for idle tasks.)</li>
<li>Calls <code>fun(args)</code> in the background session.</li>
</ol>
<p>When selecting the waiting tasks to run, the ordering of the task table
makes sure that the oldest task is selected first, and that idle tasks
are only selected if there is nothing else to run. The idle tasks make sure
that <code>schedule()</code> always has at least as many waiting tasks as ready.</p>
<p>It is possible that <code>schedule()</code> first sets an idle task to <em>waiting</em> and
then selects it and (re-)assigns a worker to it. This is perfectly fine.</p>

run a simple event loop to completion. (To run this code, first

<p>Probably no tasks are running just yet. The queue only has the chance to
change its state when you <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code> or <code>poll()</code>. When pushing the
tasks to the queue, the workers were still starting up (i.e. the idle tasks
are <em>running</em>), so <code>push()</code> could not start any real tasks. Never mind, as
soon as you try to <code>pop()</code> or <code>poll()</code>, they’ll start running:</p>

<p>The important fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result</code>: the R object returned from the function. This is <code>NULL</code> on
error.</li>
<li><code>stdout</code>: the standard output of the background session, while running the
function.</li>
<li><code>stderr</code>: the standard error.</li>
<li><code>error</code>: error object if the function failed. <code>NULL</code> otherwise.</li>
<li><code>task_id</code>: the user supplied or auto-generated task id.</li>

<p>Let’s see a task that errors.</p>

<p>The error has two parts, the first refers to the main process, and the
second is the original error, thrown in the background process. To help with
debugging, the error from the background process includes a stack trace:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>res$error$parent$trace</code></pre>

<p>For this simple function that just calls <code>stop()</code>, the trace is not
very exciting, but it can be very helpful in general.</p>

<div id="how-about-process-cleanup" class="section level2">
<h2>How about process cleanup?</h2>
<p>Luckily we don’t have to do anything extra to clean up the R processes.
<code>callr::r_session</code> objects kill their background R session in their
finalizer, i.e. when they are garbage collected. As soon as the
workers have no references, because e.g. the queue object itself has no
references, the garbage collector will clean them up. An explicit <code>kill()</code>
method would be still useful sometimes, but we leave that as an exercise to
the reader.</p>
</div>
<div id="possible-improvements" class="section level2">
<h2>Possible improvements</h2>
<p>To use this task queue in real code, you would need to make it a bit more
robust and flexible.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Most importantly, you would need to handle crashes and freezes in the
worker tasks. <code>callr::r_session</code> does handle crashes properly, i.e.
<code>poll()</code> returns immediately if the session crashes, and then <code>read()</code>
returns an informative error result. But the task queue should also do
something sensible in this case, e.g. return the error result, and
restart the worker.</li>
<li>To handle freezing worker tasks, the queue could support task timeouts,
and then kill the tasks that don’t finish before their timeout expires.
This can be probably implemented using the <code>r_session$interrupt()</code> and
<code>r_session$kill()</code> methods.</li>
<li>Make the queue interrupt-safe. All operations of the queue (e.g.
<code>poll()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, etc.) are interruptible by the user, but they
don’t always leave the task data frame and the background sessions in a
consistent state. E.g. if <code>schedule()</code> is interrupted and you are
unlucky, you might lose all worker processes. This is a very hard issue
to solve, the relatively new <code>suspendInterrupts()</code> function probably
helps a lot.</li>
<li>It would be great to be able to change the number of worker tasks of
the queue dynamically, i.e. add and remove worker processes.</li>
<li>The whole queue could be implemented in a background process, so that
the scheduler runs concurrently with the main R process. This is far
from being trivial, especially if one wants to avoid copying data
(the function arguments) twice for every task.</li>
</ol>
