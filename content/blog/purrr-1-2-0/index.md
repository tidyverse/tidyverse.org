    This release tightens up the package by removing long-deprecated functions 
    and making `map_chr()` and predicate functions more type-safe. It also 
    includes performance improvements to `every()`, `some()`, and `none()`, 
    as well as a new getting started vignette.

We're thrilled to announce the release of purrr 1.2.0! purrr enhances R's functional programming toolkit with a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.

You can install it from CRAN with:

<div class="highlight">

<pre class='chroma'><code class='language-r' data-lang='r'><span><span class='nf'><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html'>install.packages</a></span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s'>"purrr"</span><span class='o'>)</span></span></code></pre>

</div>

Overall, this is a pretty unexciting release since it primarily focusses on removing long-deprecated functions. It does, however, include a couple of small performance improvements to predicate functions and a brand new getting started vignette. You can see a full list of changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

## Lifecycle changes

-   All functions and arguments that were deprecated in purrr 0.3.0 have now been removed after being deprecated for over 5 years. These include:

    -   `%@%`
    -   `accumulate_right()`
    -   `at_depth()`
    -   `cross_d()`
    -   `cross_n()`
    -   `reduce2_right()`
    -   `reduce_right()`

-   All functions that were soft-deprecated in purrr 1.0.0 are now fully deprecated. They will continue to work but will generate a deprecation warning, and will be removed in a future release. This includes:

    -   `invoke_*()` functions
    -   `lift_*()` functions  
    -   `cross*()` functions (use [`tidyr::expand_grid()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/expand_grid.html) instead)
    -   [`prepend()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/prepend.html)
    -   `splice()`
    -   [`rbernoulli()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/rbernoulli.html)
    -   [`rdunif()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/rdunif.html)
    -   [`when()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/when.html)
    -   [`update_list()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/update_list.html)
    -   `*_raw()` functions
    -   [`vec_depth()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/pluck_depth.html)

    These deprecations help keep purrr focused on its core purpose: facilitating functional programming in R.

-   [`map_chr()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) no longer automatically coerces logical, integer, or double values to strings. Previously, this coercion happened silently, which could mask bugs in your code. Of the four CRAN packages that required fixes due to this change, two of them (50%) were bugs.

-   The predicate functions [`every()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html), [`some()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html), and [`none()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html) now require that the predicate function `.p` returns a logical scalar: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA`. Previously, `NA` values of other types (like `NA_integer_` or `NA_character_`) were allowed.

## Minor improvements

Apart from all the breaking changes, there were a couple of small improvements:

-   [`every()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html), [`some()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html), and [`none()`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/every.html) have been optimized and are now significantly faster. They're now as fast as or faster than the equivalent `any(map_lgl())` or `all(map_lgl())` calls, making them the preferred choice for checking predicates across lists.

-   purrr (finally) has a "getting started" vignette at `vignette("purrr")`.
