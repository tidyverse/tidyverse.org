### Save the date 📆

On the Saturday following [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), 
we'll be holding our first ever **tidyverse developer day**, and you're invited! 
So, if you're interested, plan to be in Austin on the 19th of January.

### Squad goals 🎯

There will be more details to come, but the idea is to have a day where we 
can work together on anything ranging from submitting your first pull request, 
to working on your own package. The tidyverse team will be there, so we can 
help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that you 
encounter. Don't have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We'll 
be tagging issues in advance to make sure there's lots to do for any- and 
everyone, regardless of level of expertise.

### Bonus 🎉

Hadley has promised "the best BBQ in Texas," so feel free to take that into 
account. We're excited to give this a whirl, and hope to see you there!

Have questions? Head over to the [tidyverse developer day](https://community.rstudio.com/t/tidyverse-developer-day/13146) thread on 
the RStudio community site!
