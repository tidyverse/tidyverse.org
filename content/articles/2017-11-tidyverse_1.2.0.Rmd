```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

We are pleased to announce the release of [tidyverse 1.2.0](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/releases) 
on CRAN (now 1.2.1, following some minor fixes) includes updates in tidyverse 
package membership, as well as to tidyverse functions themselves.

The latest version of tidyverse can be installed with:

```{r tidyverse_install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Changes in tidyverse membership

### Addition of the reprex package

Though it's been a mainstay of the tidyverse [help section](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/), 
1.2.0 marks the official addition of [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) 
(short for **repr**oducible **ex**ample) to the tidyverse. 

This means that you can now access the handy reprex **addins** from the RStudio 
drop-down menu.

### Updates to tidyverse core

The [stringr](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/) and [forcats](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/)
packages (for string, and categorical variable manipulation, respectively) have 
joined [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org/), 
[purrr](http://purrr.tidyverse.org/), and [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/) 
to make up the core tidyverse. 

Running `library(tidyverse)` attaches these core packages in the current R session.
On attach, tidyverse now makes better use of horizontal space, printing packages
and versions in two columns (see below). Additionally, packages that have 
already been attached are not be printed, and development versions are highlighted
in red. You can suppress this message using `suppressPackageStartupMessages()` 
or by setting `options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE)`.

## Other improvements

While a comprehensive list of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/releases), other highlights 
include:

 * `tidyverse_conflicts()` now prints all conflicts involving at least one
 tidyverse package (including intra-tidyverse conflicts, omitted in previous
 versions)
 
 * Addition of a `tidyverse_logo()` function.
