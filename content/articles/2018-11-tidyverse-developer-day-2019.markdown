On the Saturday following [rstudio::conf](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/), we'll be holding our first ever tidyverse developer day!

 * 📆 **When:** 19 January, 9 am - 4 pm  
 * 📍 **Where:** <PUT LOCATION HERE>  
 * 👥 **Who:** Anyone who would like to get better at contributing to the tidyverse! Everyone is welcome regardless of whether you've never done a PR before, or if you've already made your 10th package.
 * 💻 **What:** A day of learning and coding. We'll provide
breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee; you'll bring your laptop and enthusiasm.
The tidyverse team will be on hand to help out and answer your questions. We'll also host some discussions about future development plans for tidymodels.  

## Topics 🤓

The broad goal of this event is to nurture regular contributors. The tidyverse team will be there, so we can help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that you encounter. Don't have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We'll be tagging issues in advance to make sure there's lots to do for any- and everyone, regardless of level of expertise. 

We'll have tables led by different members of the team focusing on topics including: 

* First-time contributions, 
* Code makeovers, 
* rlang and tidy eval, 
* Primers, 
* Spanish translations, 
* Modelling, and 
* Repo hygiene.
