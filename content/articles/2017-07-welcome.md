Welcome to the new and improved tidyverse website. We are working hard to make tidyverse.org __the__ place to go to learn the tidyverse and to keep up to date with it as it evolves. We want <https://tidyverse.org> to be your one stop shop for everything tidy!

As well as radically improved graphic design, the site includes four new components:

* [Packages](/packages): a listing of all packages in the tidyverse, 
  broken down by domain.
  
* [Learn](/learn): our advice on learning the tidyverse.

* [Help](/help): are you stuck on something involving the tidyverse?
  Learn how to write [a reprex](/help#reprex) then learn where to ask for 
  help.

* This blog! Expect to see regular updates on what's happening in the 
  tidyverse. This includes package updates, in person events, and
  integrative case studies that show you how to use multiple packages
  from the tidyverse to solve real problems.
  
The site is made with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) and the source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org). If you spot any small mistakes please feel empowered to create a PR and fix them!
