              "response": "Looking at the submission, I need to assess whether it correctly implements the flagging criteria and follows the expected approach.\n\n**Analysis of the Submission:**\n\n1. **Correct Understanding**: The submission correctly identifies that it needs to check for:\n   - At least one \"Type_II\" instance\n   - Two or more \"Type_I\" cases within 90+ days of each other\n\n2. **Technical Implementation Issues**: \n   - The code uses `group_by()` and `summarise()` as expected\n   - However, there's a critical logical error: the condition should be `has_type2 OR type1_day_test` (using `|`), but the code uses `has_type2 & type1_day_test` (using `&`)\n   - The criterion shows the condition should be `any(type == \"Type_II\") | any(diff(sort(date[type == \"Type_I\"])) <= 90)` - note the OR operator\n\n3. **Complexity**: The submission uses a much more complex approach with `map_lgl()`, `outer()`, and list-columns, whereas the criterion shows a simpler solution using `diff(sort())`.\n\n4. **Correctness of Results**: Due to the logical error (AND instead of OR), the submission would produce incorrect results. For example:\n   - ID 000000 has Type_I visits 90+ days apart but no Type_II, so should be flagged as 1, but the code would return 0\n   - ID 000001 would work correctly only because it has both conditions\n\n5. **Style**: While the submission uses tidyverse functions, it doesn't follow the simpler, more direct approach shown in the criterion.\n\n**Comparison with Criterion:**\nThe criterion expects a solution using `group_by()` and `summarize()` with the logical OR condition. The submission uses the right structure but implements the wrong logic and uses an unnecessarily complex approach.\n\nThe fundamental logical error makes this solution incorrect for the given requirements.\n\nGRADE: I",

For example:\n   - ID 000000 has Type_I visits 90+ days apart but no Type_II, so should be flagged as 1, but the code would return 0\n   - ID 000001 would work correctly only because it has both conditions\n\n5. **Style**: While the submission uses tidyverse functions, it doesn't follow the simpler, more direct approach shown in the criterion.\n\n**Comparison with Criterion:**\nThe criterion expects a solution using `group_by()` and `summarize()` with the logical OR condition. The submission uses the right structure but implements the wrong logic and uses an unnecessarily complex approach.\n\nThe fundamental logical error makes this solution incorrect for the given requirements.\n\nGRADE: I",

This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.",

          "explanation": "Looking at the submission against the criterion, I need to evaluate two key requirements:\n\n1. **Grouping by origin airport**: The criterion emphasizes that delays should be grouped by `origin` since \"a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of JFK.\" The submission does address this correctly. While the main code doesn't group by origin, the author explicitly provides an alternative approach that does:\n\n```r\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, flight, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_prev = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\nThe author even notes \"If you want the lag within each origin airport (which might make more sense)\" showing they understand this requirement.\n\n2. **Taking mean departure delay grouped by numeric lagged departure delay**: The criterion requires that the mean departure delay should be grouped by the lagged departure delay variable. The submission does this through binning:\n\n```r\nbinned <- flights_clean %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(dep_delay_prev, breaks = seq(-50, 400, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_prev_delay = mean(dep_delay_prev, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  )\n```\n\nThis approach groups by bins of the lagged delay and computes means, which satisfies the criterion's requirement (the criterion explicitly states binning is acceptable).\n\n3. **NA handling**: The submission properly filters out NAs before computing means.\n\n4. **Visualization**: The submission creates the required plot with lagged delay on x-axis and mean current delay on y-axis.\n\nThe submission demonstrates understanding of both key requirements and provides working code that addresses them, even if the primary example doesn't combine both aspects in a single code block.\n\nGRADE: C",

So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

The aim is to **visualize the relationship between the departure delay of a flight and the departure delay of the immediately preceding flight**. A typical approach uses `lag()` to grab the previous `dep_delay` for each flight. \n\nBelow is R code using tidyverse libraries (mainly `dplyr` and `ggplot2`):\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Assuming `flights` is already loaded (from nycflights13 or your own data)\n\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, flight) %>%                  # Sort to ensure order\n  mutate(dep_delay_prev = lag(dep_delay))                          # Previous flight's dep_delay\n\n# Remove NAs and unreasonable delays for visualization clarity\nflights_clean <- flights_lagged %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_prev)) %>%\n  filter(abs(dep_delay) < 500, abs(dep_delay_prev) < 500)\n\n# Bin previous departure delay and compute average current delay per bin\nbinned <- flights_clean %>%\n  mutate(bin = cut(dep_delay_prev, breaks = seq(-50, 400, by = 10))) %>%\n  group_by(bin) %>%\n  summarize(\n    mean_prev_delay = mean(dep_delay_prev, na.rm = TRUE),\n    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  filter(n > 100) # Only plot bins with enough data\n\n# Plot: mean departure delay vs previous departure delay bin\nggplot(binned, aes(x = mean_prev_delay, y = mean_dep_delay)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mean departure delay of preceding flight (minutes)\",\n    y = \"Mean departure delay\",\n    title = \"Departure delay vs. previous flight's departure delay\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- `arrange()` orders by time to ensure the `lag()` is correct (otherwise, lag might relate to a different origin or carrier, so you might want to group or filter further, e.g., by `origin` or `carrier`).  \n- The code bins by previous delay to smooth the plot and then takes bin averages; you can also plot points directly, but a smoothed scatterplot is often clearer.\n- The plot uses a linear smoother (`geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")`) to highlight trends.\n\n---\n\n**If you want the lag within each origin airport (which might make more sense):**\n\n```r\nflights_lagged <- flights %>%\n  group_by(origin) %>%\n  arrange(year, month, day, dep_time, flight, .by_group = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_prev = lag(dep_delay)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n\nThen continue as above!\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code visualizes how departure delay propagates from one flight to the next, likely showing that delays ripple forward through the day.\n***\n[Criterion]: Notably, the relevant departure delay for this question is the one at the same\nairport. e.g. a delay at LaGuardia shouldn't affect the next flight out of\nJFK. So, the lagged departure delay should be grouped by `origin`.\n\nAlso, the mean departure delay should be taken grouped by the numeric lagged\ndeparture delay variable. This is fine, as the printed flights data shows that\nthose departure delays are in whole numbers, but it's also okay if the\nsubmitted answer rounds the lagged departure delay to the nearest minute (or\nsmall bin of minutes).\n\nHere's an example of working code:\n\n```\nlagged_delays <- \n  flights %>%\n  arrange(origin, month, day, dep_time) %>%\n  mutate(dep_delay_lag = lag(dep_delay), .by = origin) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(dep_delay_lag))\n\nlagged_delays %>%\n  summarise(dep_delay_mean = mean(dep_delay), .by = dep_delay_lag) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = dep_delay_mean, x = dep_delay_lag)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nAt some point before the mean departure delay of the current flight is taken,\nNAs need to be removed or `na.rm = TRUE` needs to be set in `mean()`.\n\nUsing the old `group_by()` syntax is also fine.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",

When you have an **unused factor level** and ask for `drop = FALSE`, ggplot will show the level in the legend—but by default, it uses the \"key glyph\" drawn by the associated geom, and if *no* data for that level are in the data, the glyph is \"blank\". That's why \"d\" shows up in the legend, but no point appears next to it.\n\nIf you want a **colored dot for \"d\"**, you need to make ggplot draw the glyph for every *color*, regardless of whether it appears in the data. The only direct solution is to provide \"dummy\" data for each unused level, so ggplot will draw a legend key for that level. Here are a few robust approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 1: Add a Fake Row**\n\nAdd a dummy row for `\"d\"` (with `NA` values for `x` and `y`) to `df`:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nWith `na.rm = TRUE`, the dummy point doesn't show up in the plot, but the legend believes it exists and draws a green dot.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Custom Legend Key with `override.aes`**\n\nForce all legend keys to use a point glyph, regardless of their presence in the data:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16)))\n```\n\nHowever, **this does not fix the \"blank\" issue** if there is no data for that color: ggplot2's default behavior is not to draw glyphs for unused levels, no matter the `override.aes`.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Dummy Data + `override.aes` for More Customization**\n\nCombine Solution 1 & 2 if you want to control *shape*, *size*, etc.:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n```\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach | Shows dot for unused level? | Drawback |\n|----------|:--------------------------:|----------|\n| Dummy row | Yes | Adds dummy row to data (must use `na.rm = TRUE`) |\n| `override.aes` only | **No**                | Legend stays blank for unused level |\n| Dummy row + `override.aes`| Yes          | More control, but still requires dummy row |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIf you want a colored dot for unused legend levels, you **must** provide dummy data for that level so ggplot knows to draw a key. Then use `na.rm = TRUE` in your `geom_point()` call to suppress them from the plot.\n\n---\n\n### Final code (recommended):\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will **ensure the green dot appears in the legend** for \"d\", just like the other levels."

When you have an **unused factor level** and ask for `drop = FALSE`, ggplot will show the level in the legend—but by default, it uses the \"key glyph\" drawn by the associated geom, and if *no* data for that level are in the data, the glyph is \"blank\". That's why \"d\" shows up in the legend, but no point appears next to it.\n\nIf you want a **colored dot for \"d\"**, you need to make ggplot draw the glyph for every *color*, regardless of whether it appears in the data. The only direct solution is to provide \"dummy\" data for each unused level, so ggplot will draw a legend key for that level. Here are a few robust approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 1: Add a Fake Row**\n\nAdd a dummy row for `\"d\"` (with `NA` values for `x` and `y`) to `df`:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nWith `na.rm = TRUE`, the dummy point doesn't show up in the plot, but the legend believes it exists and draws a green dot.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Custom Legend Key with `override.aes`**\n\nForce all legend keys to use a point glyph, regardless of their presence in the data:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16)))\n```\n\nHowever, **this does not fix the \"blank\" issue** if there is no data for that color: ggplot2's default behavior is not to draw glyphs for unused levels, no matter the `override.aes`.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Dummy Data + `override.aes` for More Customization**\n\nCombine Solution 1 & 2 if you want to control *shape*, *size*, etc.:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n```\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach | Shows dot for unused level? | Drawback |\n|----------|:--------------------------:|----------|\n| Dummy row | Yes | Adds dummy row to data (must use `na.rm = TRUE`) |\n| `override.aes` only | **No**                | Legend stays blank for unused level |\n| Dummy row + `override.aes`| Yes          | More control, but still requires dummy row |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIf you want a colored dot for unused legend levels, you **must** provide dummy data for that level so ggplot knows to draw a key. Then use `na.rm = TRUE` in your `geom_point()` call to suppress them from the plot.\n\n---\n\n### Final code (recommended):\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will **ensure the green dot appears in the legend** for \"d\", just like the other levels.",

                      "text": "This is a subtle but classic issue in **ggplot2**! When you have an **unused factor level** and ask for `drop = FALSE`, ggplot will show the level in the legend—but by default, it uses the \"key glyph\" drawn by the associated geom, and if *no* data for that level are in the data, the glyph is \"blank\". That's why \"d\" shows up in the legend, but no point appears next to it.\n\nIf you want a **colored dot for \"d\"**, you need to make ggplot draw the glyph for every *color*, regardless of whether it appears in the data. The only direct solution is to provide \"dummy\" data for each unused level, so ggplot will draw a legend key for that level. Here are a few robust approaches:\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 1: Add a Fake Row**\n\nAdd a dummy row for `\"d\"` (with `NA` values for `x` and `y`) to `df`:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nWith `na.rm = TRUE`, the dummy point doesn't show up in the plot, but the legend believes it exists and draws a green dot.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Custom Legend Key with `override.aes`**\n\nForce all legend keys to use a point glyph, regardless of their presence in the data:\n\n```r\nggplot(data = df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16)))\n```\n\nHowever, **this does not fix the \"blank\" issue** if there is no data for that color: ggplot2's default behavior is not to draw glyphs for unused levels, no matter the `override.aes`.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Dummy Data + `override.aes` for More Customization**\n\nCombine Solution 1 & 2 if you want to control *shape*, *size*, etc.:\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  ) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 16, size = 3)))\n```\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach | Shows dot for unused level? | Drawback |\n|----------|:--------------------------:|----------|\n| Dummy row | Yes | Adds dummy row to data (must use `na.rm = TRUE`) |\n| `override.aes` only | **No**                | Legend stays blank for unused level |\n| Dummy row + `override.aes`| Yes          | More control, but still requires dummy row |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nIf you want a colored dot for unused legend levels, you **must** provide dummy data for that level so ggplot knows to draw a key. Then use `na.rm = TRUE` in your `geom_point()` call to suppress them from the plot.\n\n---\n\n### Final code (recommended):\n\n```r\ndf_aug <- rbind(\n  df,\n  data.frame(x = NA, y = NA, z = factor(\"d\", levels = letters[1:4]))\n)\n\nggplot(data = df_aug) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, color = z), na.rm = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    drop = FALSE,\n    values = c(a = \"red\", b = \"blue\", c = \"yellow\", d = \"green\")\n  )\n```\n\nThis will **ensure the green dot appears in the legend** for \"d\", just like the other levels."

The submission also includes proper explanation and uses `library(dplyr)` which shows good practice.\n\nThe only minor differences are:\n1. Uses `%>%` instead of `|>` (both are valid pipe operators)\n2.

These cause your URL to be malformed, which is what the error message is telling you.\n\nYou **must URL-encode** the query parameter (`address`) before using it in your URL.\n\nThere are **two ways** to fix this in R:\n\n---\n\n## **1. URL-Encode the Address Parameter**\n\nYou can use `utils::URLencode()` or, for more robustness, `curl::curl_escape()`.\n\n**Here's how you can update your code:**\n\n```r\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\n# URL-encode the address\nencoded_address <- curl::curl_escape(address)\n\nurl <- glue(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search?q={encoded_address}&api_key={api_key}\")\n\nresponse <- httr2::request(url) %>% httr2::req_perform()\n```\nor using `utils::URLencode` (**set reserved=TRUE** is important to encode special characters like `,`):\n\n```r\nencoded_address <- utils::URLencode(address, reserved = TRUE)\n```\n\n---\n\n## **2. Use httr2's Query Parameter Handling**\n\n`httr2::request()` allows you to add query parameters using `httr2::req_url_query()`, which handles URL-encoding for you:\n\n```r\nlibrary(httr2)\n\naddress <- \"Prince st., New York 10012\"\napi_key <- \"my_secret_api_key\"\n\nreq <- request(\"https://geocode.maps.co/search\") %>%\n  req_url_query(q = address, api_key = api_key)\n\nresp <- req_perform(req)\n```\nThis approach is neater and avoids manual URL construction or encoding.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Approach      | How?                                                      |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Manual        | Encode using `curl_escape()` or `URLencode()` in the URL  |\n| Automatic     | Use `req_url_query()` for parameter handling & encoding   |\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n**Use method 2**—it's safer and more readable!\n\n---\n\n## **Why did this happen?**\nSpecial characters (spaces, commas, etc.) are not valid in URLs. They must be \"URL-encoded\" (replaced with `%20`, `%2C`, etc.). Your API call failed because the raw address string caused the URL to become invalid.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nUse `req_url_query()` to handle query parameters and encoding, or manually encode variables that go in URLs."

The warning/message\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n```\n**Explanation:**  \nAfter your `summarize()` call, because you grouped by *two* variables (`carrier, month`), `summarize()` reduces one level (here, it drops `month` and leaves you grouped by `carrier`). That's just letting you know how grouping works in dplyr by default.\n\n**This message itself isn't an error, but it clues you in that your data is still grouped by `carrier`, which can affect subsequent steps.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. The filter operation:\n```r\nfilter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\nBecause your data is grouped by `carrier` at this stage, `min(median_arr_delay)` is computed *for each carrier*, **not globally.** So you'll get the rows for the lowest median delay for each carrier, not across all combinations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How to fix it**\n\nYou want the single **lowest** median arrival delay across all `carrier`-by-`month` combinations. To get the correct result:\n\n1. **Ungroup** after summarise, so `filter()` operates on the whole summary table.\n2. Now, `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` will match all row(s) with the global minimum.\n\n#### **Fixed pipeline:**\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- `ungroup()` is the key step!\n\n**This will give you the row(s) for the (possibly multiple) carrier+month combo(s) with the lowest median arrival delay in the dataset.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- That dplyr message informs you about how grouping works; it isn't an error.\n- Your filter step was working group-wise, but for a global minimum, you need to `ungroup()` first.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the output, or extending this to get e.g. the *best carrier* or *best month* overall!**"

                      "text": "Great questions! Let's break down what's happening and how you can fix your `dplyr` pipeline.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The warning/message\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n```\n**Explanation:**  \nAfter your `summarize()` call, because you grouped by *two* variables (`carrier, month`), `summarize()` reduces one level (here, it drops `month` and leaves you grouped by `carrier`). That's just letting you know how grouping works in dplyr by default.\n\n**This message itself isn't an error, but it clues you in that your data is still grouped by `carrier`, which can affect subsequent steps.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. The filter operation:\n```r\nfilter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\nBecause your data is grouped by `carrier` at this stage, `min(median_arr_delay)` is computed *for each carrier*, **not globally.** So you'll get the rows for the lowest median delay for each carrier, not across all combinations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How to fix it**\n\nYou want the single **lowest** median arrival delay across all `carrier`-by-`month` combinations. To get the correct result:\n\n1. **Ungroup** after summarise, so `filter()` operates on the whole summary table.\n2. Now, `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` will match all row(s) with the global minimum.\n\n#### **Fixed pipeline:**\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- `ungroup()` is the key step!\n\n**This will give you the row(s) for the (possibly multiple) carrier+month combo(s) with the lowest median arrival delay in the dataset.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- That dplyr message informs you about how grouping works; it isn't an error.\n- Your filter step was working group-wise, but for a global minimum, you need to `ungroup()` first.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the output, or extending this to get e.g. the *best carrier* or *best month* overall!**"

                  "text": "Great questions! Let's break down what's happening and how you can fix your `dplyr` pipeline.\n\n---\n\n### 1. The warning/message\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'carrier'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n```\n**Explanation:**  \nAfter your `summarize()` call, because you grouped by *two* variables (`carrier, month`), `summarize()` reduces one level (here, it drops `month` and leaves you grouped by `carrier`). That's just letting you know how grouping works in dplyr by default.\n\n**This message itself isn't an error, but it clues you in that your data is still grouped by `carrier`, which can affect subsequent steps.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. The filter operation:\n```r\nfilter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\nBecause your data is grouped by `carrier` at this stage, `min(median_arr_delay)` is computed *for each carrier*, **not globally.** So you'll get the rows for the lowest median delay for each carrier, not across all combinations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How to fix it**\n\nYou want the single **lowest** median arrival delay across all `carrier`-by-`month` combinations. To get the correct result:\n\n1. **Ungroup** after summarise, so `filter()` operates on the whole summary table.\n2. Now, `filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))` will match all row(s) with the global minimum.\n\n#### **Fixed pipeline:**\n```r\nflights |>\n  group_by(carrier, month) |>\n  summarize(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  filter(median_arr_delay == min(median_arr_delay))\n```\n\n- `ungroup()` is the key step!\n\n**This will give you the row(s) for the (possibly multiple) carrier+month combo(s) with the lowest median arrival delay in the dataset.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n- That dplyr message informs you about how grouping works; it isn't an error.\n- Your filter step was working group-wise, but for a global minimum, you need to `ungroup()` first.\n\n---\n\n**Let me know if you want help interpreting the output, or extending this to get e.g. the *best carrier* or *best month* overall!**",

          "explanation": "Looking at the submission against the three main steps in the criterion:\n\n**Step 1 - Grouped filter**: The criterion requires filtering to keep only rows where tailnum has >100 flights, without persistent summarization. The submission instead uses `summarise()` to create aggregated statistics and then filters on `n_flights >= 100`. This approach creates a summarized dataset rather than filtering the original rows, which doesn't match the required approach.\n\n**Step 2 - Grouped summarize**: The submission correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NA values, which is the correct method specified in the criterion.\n\n**Step 3 - Arrange by descending order**: The submission correctly uses `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))` to sort by the proportion in descending order.\n\nThe submission also correctly ignores the `planes` data as specified.\n\nHowever, the fundamental issue is with Step 1. The criterion emphasizes that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in the filtering step, but the submission's approach creates a persistent summary with counts and proportions before filtering. The correct approach should filter the original flight records first, then summarize.\n\nThe submission produces functionally similar results but uses a different methodology that doesn't follow the specified approach of filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P",

The submission instead uses `summarise()` to create aggregated statistics and then filters on `n_flights >= 100`. This approach creates a summarized dataset rather than filtering the original rows, which doesn't match the required approach.\n\n**Step 2 - Grouped summarize**: The submission correctly uses `mean(is.na(arr_delay))` to calculate the proportion of NA values, which is the correct method specified in the criterion.\n\n**Step 3 - Arrange by descending order**: The submission correctly uses `arrange(desc(prop_na_arr_delay))` to sort by the proportion in descending order.\n\nThe submission also correctly ignores the `planes` data as specified.\n\nHowever, the fundamental issue is with Step 1. The criterion emphasizes that \"no persistent summarization across rows should happen\" in the filtering step, but the submission's approach creates a persistent summary with counts and proportions before filtering. The correct approach should filter the original flight records first, then summarize.\n\nThe submission produces functionally similar results but uses a different methodology that doesn't follow the specified approach of filtering first, then summarizing.\n\nGRADE: P"

So for all months in all years, it's treating everything as one long sequence and the year is just coloring the points—but not creating separate lines for each year.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\nYou need to **group by year** in the plot.  \nThere are two ways to do this:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Add `group = year` to your aesthetics:**\n\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n- `group = year` tells ggplot to draw a separate line for each year.\n- `factor(year)` is recommended for color so the legend is categorical, not continuous.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Use `group = interaction(year)` for more complex grouping (optional)**\n\nIf you need a combination of multiple grouping variables:\n```r\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\nBut in your case, just `group = year` is enough.\n\n---\n\n### **Result**\n\nEach year will be a separate colored line, each one tracing the median unemployment duration for months 1 to 12.\n\n---\n\n**Extra tip:**  \nIf you want months to be labeled with abbreviations, use:\n```r\nscale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb)\n```\nor if you have a column with month names, set `x = month_name`.\n\n---\n\n**Full Example:**\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +\n  labs(color = \"Year\", x = \"Month\", y = \"Median Weeks Unemployed\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n> 🟢 **Add `group = year` inside your `aes()`:**\n\n```r\naes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)\n```\n\nThat's it!\n***\n[Criterion]: You need to use the `group` aesthetic to indicate which observations should be connected together.\nSince you want a separate line for each year, you need to set `group = year` in your aesthetic mappings.\n\n```\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = year)) +\n  geom_line()\n```  \n\nIf you want year to be treated as a discrete variable for the legend, you can also transform year to a factor.\n\n```\nggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, group = year, color = as.factor(year))) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n\nHowever note that a discrete scale for more than eight levels is usually not recommended.\n***\n[END DATA]\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' where\nLETTER is one of C, P, or I.\nPlease choose ONE option: either 'C' for correct answers, \"P\" for partially correct answers,\nor 'I' for incorrect answers.\nFirst explain your reasoning, then end with GRADE: $LETTER.\nDo not format the grading string and do not include any punctuation or\nexposition after it.",
              "response": "Looking at the criterion and the submission:\n\nThe criterion requires explaining that the `group` aesthetic is needed to indicate which observations should be connected together, and specifically that `group = year` should be set since we want a separate line for each year.\n\nThe submission correctly identifies this core issue and provides the right solution. Key strengths:\n\n1. **Correctly diagnoses the problem**: Explains that `geom_line()` connects all data points in order and that grouping by year is needed for separate lines\n2. **Provides the correct solution**: Shows `group = year` in the aesthetic mappings\n3. **Includes the exact code needed**: `ggplot(unemployment, aes(x = month, y = uempmed, color = factor(year), group = year)) + geom_line()`\n4. **Explains the factor conversion**: Mentions using `factor(year)` for categorical coloring, which aligns with the criterion's suggestion about treating year as discrete\n5. **Goes beyond minimum requirements**: Provides additional helpful context, formatting tips, and a complete example\n\nThe submission thoroughly addresses the criterion's requirements while providing additional valuable information.

To do this robustly, use **non-standard evaluation** (NSE) techniques, such as `substitute()` or `rlang` functions, and then convert to a string.\n\nHere's an updated version of your function supporting this:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = deparse(substitute(dataset)),\n  dir = inspect_log_dir()\n) {\n  check_dataset(dataset)\n\n  dataset$id <- seq_len(nrow(dataset))\n\n  res <-\n    structure(\n      dataset,\n      class = c(\"task\", class(tibble::new_tibble(list())))\n    )\n\n  attr(res, \"dir\") <- dir\n  attr(res, \"name\") <- name\n\n  res\n}\n```\n\n**Usage example:**\n\n```r\neval <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:3)\nx <- task_create(dataset = eval)\n# attr(x, \"name\") will be \"eval\"\n\nanother_df <- tibble::tibble(y = 1:5)\ny <- task_create(dataset = another_df, name = \"foobar\")\n# attr(y, \"name\") will be \"foobar\"\n```\n\n### Optional: Use `{rlang}` for more robustness\n\nIf you want to handle more cases (e.g., supporting pipes or more complex NSE), consider:\n\n```r\ntask_create <- function(\n  dataset,\n  name = rlang::as_label(rlang::enquo(dataset)),\n  dir = inspect_log_dir()\n) {\n  check_dataset(dataset)\n\n  dataset$id <- seq_len(nrow(dataset))\n\n  res <-\n    structure(\n      dataset,\n      class = c(\"task\", class(tibble::new_tibble(list())))\n    )\n\n  attr(res, \"dir\") <- dir\n  attr(res, \"name\") <- name\n\n  res\n}\n```\n\nBoth versions will default the `name` argument to the textual expression you passed for `dataset`.  \nIf you supply your own `name`, it overrides the default.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of changes:**\n\n- Added a `name` argument to the function, with default `deparse(substitute(dataset))` (or `rlang::as_label(rlang::enquo(dataset))`).\n- `attr(res, \"name\") <- name` in the body.\n- Usage works as desired.",

          "explanation": "The submission correctly identifies the core issue and provides the right solution.

                  "text": "Great question! You're right—this is a **namespacing** issue that comes up when you use Shiny modules with dynamically generated UIs (`renderUI`). This is one of the trickiest aspects when nesting modules.\n\nHere's a clear summary of the issue and solution:\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nYou're using `ns <- NS(id)` **inside** both `inner_UI()` and `innerServer()`, and in `innerServer()` you use `output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({ ... })` to generate additional outputs (`verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\"))`, `plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))`) *dynamically*.\n\nHowever:  \nFor dynamically generated outputs **inside a module**, you have to remember that:\n\n1. The **output ID** used in `output$[id] <- ...` is referenced **without** the namespace.\n2. The **output ID** used in `XXXOutput(ns(\"...\"))` must include the correct namespace function `ns()`.\n\nBut **inside** a module's server, using `ns <- NS(id)` is actually problematic: in a `moduleServer` the `session$ns` function *already* is the correct namespace, and you should use `session$ns` (or just `ns` if you assign `ns <- session$ns`).\n\nSo the root of your problem is **double namespacing** of output IDs in the server code.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n1. **UI functions:** It's correct to use `ns <- NS(id)` to namespace the output IDs.\n2. **Server functions:** You should use the output IDs *without* extra namespacing (i.e., don't call `ns(\"someId\")` in the server part; simply use `\"someId\"`).\n\nSo, **change this in your server function**:\n\n```r\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    # Use the session's ns function\n    ns <- session$ns\n\n    # The output IDs are always registered WITHOUT namespacing\n    output$someText <- renderText({ \"something\" })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({ \"something generated\" })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n        ggtitle(\"The title:\")\n    })\n\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n\nNotice:\n- `output$theChart` instead of `output$theChart <-`.\n- In renderUI, use `ns(\"someTextGenerated\")`, but when registering outputs, use `\"someTextGenerated\"` (no `ns`).\n\n---\n\n## Full Working Example\n\nHere’s your **fixed app**, ready to run:\n\n```r\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ninner_UI <- function(id){\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    h4(\"inner_UI:\", id),\n    uiOutput(ns(\"theGeneratedUI\")),\n    verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someText\"))\n  )\n}\n\ninnerServer <- function(id){\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns  # use the session's namespacing\n\n    output$someText <- renderText({\n      \"something\"\n    })\n    output$someTextGenerated <- renderText({\n      \"something generated\"\n    })\n    output$theChart <- renderPlot({\n      t.x <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.y <- sample(1:25, 25)\n      t.df <- data.frame(x=t.x, y=t.y)\n      ggplot(data=t.df) +\n        geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) + \n        ggtitle(paste0(\"The title:\"))\n    })\n    output$theGeneratedUI <- renderUI({\n      tagList(\n        h5(\"Inside theGeneratedUI\"),\n        verbatimTextOutput(ns(\"someTextGenerated\")),\n        plotOutput(ns(\"theChart\"))\n      )\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nouter_UI <- function(id) {\n  ns <- NS(id)\n  tagList(\n    fluidRow(\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner1\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner2\"))),\n      column(4, inner_UI(ns(\"inner3\")))\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nouterServer <- function(id) {\n  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {\n    ns <- session$ns\n    innerServer(\"inner1\")\n    innerServer(\"inner2\")\n    innerServer(\"inner3\")\n  })\n}\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  outer_UI(\"outer1\")\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  outerServer(\"outer1\")\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n- In `renderUI`, always wrap dynamically created outputs with the module's namespacing: `ns(\"id\")`\n- When *registering* outputs in the module's server, **do not namespace the output ID**.\n- In the server, use `session$ns` for namespacing inside `renderUI`, but never to register output IDs.\n\n---\n\nThis pattern will always work for **nested modules with dynamic UI**!",

The issue is a namespacing problem with dynamically generated UI in nested modules\n2. Using `ns <- NS(id)` in the server is problematic and causes \"double namespacing\"\n3. The solution is to use `ns <- session$ns` instead\n4. This ensures dynamically generated UI elements have properly qualified namespaces\n\nThe submission provides the exact code change specified in the criterion (changing from `ns <- NS(id)` to `ns <- session$ns`) and includes a complete working example. The explanation goes beyond the minimum requirement by providing additional context about how namespacing works in Shiny modules and why this pattern is necessary for nested modules with dynamic UI.\n\nThe technical explanation is accurate and the solution directly addresses the criterion's requirements.\n\nGRADE: C"

Where it Goes Wrong\n\nSome installation tools (primarily `remotes`, but also `pak` used by pkgdown actions) must reconcile the two:\n1. They **read your DESCRIPTION** and see you depend on **spatialstuff**.\n2. They see your **Remotes** is `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n3. They go to `org/spatial-Stuff`, clone it, and check: does it contain a package called `spatialstuff`?\n    - If **yes**, installation should work.\n    - If **no** (e.g. the `Package:` in its DESCRIPTION is `spatial-Stuff` or it's not an R package), it fails.\n\n### 3. **Potential Pitfalls**\n- **Repo name ≠ package name.** This is fine ONLY IF the _package's_ DESCRIPTION is `Package: spatialstuff`.\n- **Case matters:** R package names are almost always lower-case, and must be referenced that way in the `Imports`.\n- **If the GitHub repo isn't a valid R package:** installation will fail.\n\n---\n\n## Typical Causes\n\n- **The GitHub repo at `org/spatial-Stuff` is NOT an R package** called `spatialstuff` (maybe it's called `spatial-Stuff`).\n- There's a **case mismatch** (`SpatialStuff` vs `spatialstuff`, but R is case sensitive).\n- The package at that repo has not been installed because `Remotes` isn't being picked up during the CI step due to how the workflow installs dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## How to Debug & Fix\n\n1. **Check the target repo's `DESCRIPTION`**\n    - Go to `https://github.com/org/spatial-Stuff/blob/main/DESCRIPTION`\n    - The line must read: `Package: spatialstuff`.  \n    - If it does **not** (e.g. `Package: spatial-Stuff` or `Package: spatialStuff`), that's the problem.  \n        - The value after `Imports:` must match **exactly**, including case.\n\n2. **If you have no control over the external package**\n    - **Imports:** must **always** use the actual R package name (as declared by that package itself).\n    - If it's declared as `Package: spatial-Stuff`, you must `Imports: spatial-Stuff`.\n    - However, by R conventions, package names should be lower case, and many tools expect this.\n    - CRAN and base R don't allow package names with `-`, but `remotes`/`devtools` can install such packages from GitHub, but can be flaky.\n\n3. **If you must use a package with a problematic name**\n    - Strongly suggest **asking the maintainers** to use a CRAN-compliant name.\n    - If not possible, you may still be able to install it locally, but _automated CI_ (such as pkgdown actions) may not reliably install it.\n\n---\n\n## **Likely Root Cause For You**\n**The actual R package in `org/spatial-Stuff` is not named `spatialstuff`.**  (Check the `DESCRIPTION` of that repo, see the `Package:` field.)\n\n## **Recommended Course of Action**\n\n### 1. **If you control `spatial-Stuff` repo**:\n- Ensure the `DESCRIPTION` reads: `Package: spatialstuff`\n- Then your current `DESCRIPTION` (with `Imports: spatialstuff` and `Remotes: org/spatial-Stuff`) is fine.\n\n### 2. **If you *don't* control the repo**:\n- Check what the actual declared package name is in that repo.\n- **Match** that exactly in your `Imports:`.\n    - E.g. If it is `Package: spatial-Stuff`, change your `Imports:` to `spatial-Stuff`.\n\n**Warning:** Non-CRAN-compliant names (with `-`) will cause issues with many R tools, including pkgdown and Github Actions.\n\n### 3. **If possible, ask package maintainers to use CRAN-compliant names**\n\n---\n\n## **In Summary**\n- **You must use the actual package name as declared in `DESCRIPTION`** of the remote (after `Package:`), regardless of repo name.\n- If the repo/package author's choice leads to a non-CRAN-compliant or case-mismatched package name, **automated tools may fail** to install it; this is not your fault, but a consequence of their naming.\n\n> **User Error?** *Only if your `Imports:` package name does not match the package's own `Package:` field. Otherwise, it's a packaging issue on their side.*\n\n---\n\n## **Extra: How does pkgdown workflow install dependencies?**\n```yaml\n- name: Install dependencies\n  run: |\n    Rscript -e 'pak::pak(\"local::.\", dependencies = TRUE)'\n```\n- This should understand `Remotes:` and pull the right git repo, but **only if the package name matches.**\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR  \n**Check the `Package:` field in `org/spatial-Stuff` repo's DESCRIPTION.  \nYour `Imports:` must match that name exactly.**  \n\nIf you do this and tools still choke due to a non-CRAN-compliant name, the best fix is to convince the maintainers to use a safe name.\n\n---\n\n### **If you give the actual repo/package name, I can check and give the exact line to use!**"

Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it.\n\n---\n\n## What's Happening\n\n### 1. `DESCRIPTION`:\nYour `DESCRIPTION` is correct, **as long as**:\n```r\nImports:\n    spatialstuff\n\nRemotes:\n    org/spatial-Stuff\n```\n- **`Imports:`** requires the R **package name** (what appears in the package's own `DESCRIPTION` field, `Package: spatialstuff`).\n- **`Remotes:`** requires the **GitHub repo**, i.e. `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n\n### 2. Where it Goes Wrong\n\nSome installation tools (primarily `remotes`, but also `pak` used by pkgdown actions) must reconcile the two:\n1. They **read your DESCRIPTION** and see you depend on **spatialstuff**.\n2. They see your **Remotes** is `org/spatial-Stuff`.\n3.

But **R6 does not allow overwriting of public methods at the instance level** (after initial class creation), causing the \"cannot change value of locked binding\" error.\n\n### How to fix this\n\n#### **Best Practice: Avoid dynamically creating public methods**\nIf you want a method to be overridable, **define it statically** in the `public` list of `Parent`. Only fields/values are meant to be dynamically assigned. Methods should be declared in the class definition.\n\n#### **Solution 1: Define `foo` in the public list**\nThis allows clean inheritance and overriding:\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print('foo')\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# [1] \"foo\"\n```\n\n#### **If you must dynamically assign (`self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...`)…**\n\n1. **Remove or change the name in `Child`**\n   If you keep the dynamic assignment, **you cannot override/define `foo` in `Child`'s public list**—that's what causes the binding error. Only fields declared as `NULL` can be assigned at the instance level, but dynamic method assignment is discouraged for public methods.\n\n2. **Switch to private members if required**\n   If you want to assign at run-time, consider using `private$` instead (for fields).\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Dynamic (`self[[\"foo\"]] <- ...`) | Overridable? | Works with inheritance? |\n|---|---|---|\n| No (avoid) | No | Causes error |\n| Statically in `public` list | Yes | Yes |\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Declare public methods at class-definition time**, not dynamically in `initialize`.\n- If you want sub-classes to override them, **put them in the public list**.\n- **Don't assign public functions dynamically** if you want inheritance to work.\n\n### **Your corrected code** (best practice):\n\n```r\nParent <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Parent\",\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      print(\"foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nChild <- R6::R6Class(\n  \"Child\",\n  inherit = Parent,\n  public = list(\n    foo = function() {\n      super$foo()\n      print(\"child foo\")\n    }\n  )\n)\n\nchild <- Child$new()\nchild$foo()\n# \"foo\"\n# \"child foo\"\n```\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- [R6 documentation, Method overriding](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Inheritance.html)\n- [StackOverflow: R6 dynamic method problems](https://stackoverflow.com/q/30265941/)\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n**Do not dynamically assign public methods in initialize — define them in the public list for proper inheritance and overriding.**",

When R tries to resolve `chat = chat`, it gets stuck: where does the default value come from? The inner `chat`? The outer `chat`? They're named the same, causing confusion.\n\n## How to fix\n\n### Solution: Use a **different name** for the argument, or explicitly capture the outer `chat`. Common R idioms:\n\n### **Option 1: Use another variable name**\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, this_chat = chat) {\n    ch <- this_chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nNow there's no confusion; the closure captures `chat` in the outer function.\n\n### **Option 2: Use force() to capture the variable**\nTo ensure `chat` is fully evaluated in the outer function (and not re-evaluated in the inner function's default), you can `force(chat)`:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  force(chat)  # ensure chat is evaluated now, not later\n  function(input, chat = chat) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\nBut it's still safest to avoid default arguments with the same name as an outer variable.\n\n### **Option 3: No default, just pass explicitly if needed**\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat) {\n    if (missing(chat)) chat <- chat  # not recommended; gets ambiguous\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\nBut this is less clear and can be dangerous.\n\n## **Recommended fix**\n\n**Best practice:** Use different names to avoid shadowing:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input, chat_arg = chat) {\n    ch <- chat_arg$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr if you don't need to override `chat` in the inner function at all, just use:\n\n```r\ngenerate <- function(chat = ellmer::chat_claude()) {\n  function(input) {\n    ch <- chat$clone()\n    res <- ch$chat(input)\n    list(result = res, chat = ch)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## **Summary**\n- **Do not use the same argument name for both the inner function and its default argument.**\n- **Use a different name** or explicitly `force()` the outer variable.\n- This will fix your \"promise already under evaluation\" error.\n\n---\n\n**Example demo:**\n\n```r\ngen <- generate()\ngen(\"hello\")\n```\nShould now work without errors."

In Shiny, *all* access to `input`, `output`, and reactivity **must** be inside the `server` function.\n\n## What's wrong?\n\n- You have `reactive()` expressions (`filtered_data`, etc.), the `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})`, and your data manipulations at the top-level script, not _inside_ the server function.\n- Then, in your call to `shinyApp()`, your server function is essentially just:\n\n  ```r\n  function(input, output) {\n    output$plot\n  }\n  ```\n\nThis does **not** define any renderings/output for \"plot\", hence Shiny says it \"Can't read output 'plot'\".\n\n## How do you fix this?\n\n### **Move all input/output/reactive code _inside_ the `server` function!**\n\nHere is a **working, reorganized Shiny app** with the same logic:\n\n```r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# Load & Rename data \nKidney_Correlations_Data <- read_excel(\"Kidney Correlations Data.xlsx\")\nKidney_Correlations_Data <- as.data.frame(Kidney_Correlations_Data) %>%\n  mutate(\n    CKD_STAGE = str_replace(Kidney_Correlations_Data[[3]], \"CKD 3.*\", \"CKD 3\")\n  )\n\n# UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  sidebarLayout(\n    sidebarPanel(\n      selectInput(\"condition\", \"Select CKD Condition:\", c(\"CKD 3\", \"CKD 4\", \"CKD 5\", \"ESRD\")),\n      numericInput(\"visit_threshold\", \"Minimum Visit Count:\", value = 5, min = 0)\n    ),\n    mainPanel(\n      plotOutput(\"plot\")\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# SERVER\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n\n  filtered_data <- reactive({\n    req(input$condition, input$visit_threshold)\n    Kidney_Correlations_Data %>% \n      filter(\n        CKD_STAGE == input$condition,\n        VISIT_COUNT > input$visit_threshold\n      )\n  })\n  \n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\n    data <- filtered_data()\n    \n    validate(\n      need(nrow(data) > 0, \"No data to plot for selected filters.\")\n    )\n    \n    lm_model <- lm(Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED ~ VISIT_COUNT, data = data)\n    \n    ggplot(data, aes(x = VISIT_COUNT, y = Sum_Sum_MR_ALLOWED)) + \n      geom_point() + \n      geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n      labs(x = \"Visit Count\", y = \"Paid Amount\")\n  })\n}\n\n# APP\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Main Fixes & Takeaways\n- Place all code that uses `input`, `output`, or `reactive` **inside** the `server` function.\n- Your server function should create the reactivity, and define all `output$` (e.g. `output$plot`) bindings.\n- Pass the server function directly into `shinyApp(ui = ..., server = ...)`.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n> **Move your reactive/filter/plot code inside the server function. That's where Shiny expects it to be. The error goes away and your app works.**",

          "explanation": "I need to assess whether the submission meets the criterion of calling `str_replace()` twice, once for each pair of pipes, without using `str_replace_all()`.\n\nLet me analyze the submission:\n\n**What the submission does correctly:**\n1. Uses `str_replace()` twice in sequence, not `str_replace_all()`\n2. First call replaces the first `||` with \"T\"\n3. Second call replaces the remaining `||` with \"A\"\n4. Uses proper regex escaping `\\\\|\\\\|` for the pipe characters\n5. Provides multiple working code examples\n6. Produces the correct output\n7. Uses tidyverse functions as requested\n\n**Comparing to the criterion:**\nThe criterion expects:\n- Call `str_replace()` twice ✓ (submission does this)\n- Once for first pair of pipes, once for second ✓ (submission does this)\n- Should not use `str_replace_all()` ✓ (submission doesn't use this)\n- Using `||` for pattern is fine with `fixed = TRUE` (criterion notes this as alternative, but regex approach with `\\\\|\\\\|` is also valid)\n- Can assign to either `appointment_key` or `result` ✓ (submission shows both approaches)\n\n**Key technical correctness:**\nThe submission's approach is technically sound. By calling `str_replace()` twice sequentially, it first replaces the first occurrence of `||` with \"T\", then in the modified string, replaces the next occurrence of `||` with \"A\".

In the explanation, it states:\n- \"Setting `.names = \"x\"` will **name the new column actually as \"x\"** (if that's your intention), *but* you have an extra comma at the end (`.names = \"x\",`) which makes R think you're supplying more arguments.\"\n- \"...suggests that the anonymous function is being called incorrectly with arguments it wasn't expecting, **often due to extra or misplaced commas.**\"\n\nUnder \"Fix 1: Remove the Trailing Comma\" it provides the corrected code:\n```r\nmtcars |>\n  mutate(across(vs, \\(x) x + 1, .names = \"x\"))\n```\n\nAnd in the summary it explicitly states:\n- \"Remove the extra comma after `.names = \"x\"`.\"\n- \"**That's it! The key issue was the extraneous comma.**\"\n\nThe submission directly addresses the criterion by identifying the trailing comma as the problem and providing the solution to remove it. While it also provides additional context and alternative solutions, it clearly meets the specific criterion of identifying and fixing the trailing comma issue.\n\nGRADE: C"

But this will break on build/check, or (critically!) when used by others.\n\n**Why is this a problem?**\n\n- **CRAN build checks** and R best practice require using **only exported functions** from dependencies, referenced as `pkg::fun()`.  \n- Using internal/non-exported functions can lead to broken code: the function could be removed, changed, or renamed at any time, as there's no guarantee on internal API stability.\n\n---\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. **Avoid using `dplyr::closest`**\n**Best Practice:** Use only exported, public functions.  \n**Check:** Is there an *exported* function in `dplyr` (or another package) that does what you need instead of `closest()`?\n\n- If so, use that function instead.\n\n### 2. **Copy the code (if it's simple and licenses permit)**\nIf you **must** use the functionality and it's a simple helper:\n- Copy the function's code into your package, crediting the source and license.\n- Rename it to avoid conflicts.\n\n### 3. **Access the function via `:::`, but don't do this for packages**\nYou *can* do `dplyr:::closest()` to access non-exported functions **in interactive exploration**, but **never** use this in package code (CRAN will reject it; it's fragile as internals may change).\n\n### 4. **Ask maintainers**\nIf you believe `closest()` is widely useful, consider opening an issue in the `dplyr` repo and requesting export (or asking if there's an alternative).\n\n---\n\n## What should you do in your package?\n\n- **Do not use `closest()` directly** unless it is exported by `dplyr` (it's not).\n- Do not rely on \"it works in my environment\"—it won't work reliably for all users.\n- **Either replace it** with a public, exported alternative, or copy the code with attribution.\n- If you copy, document this *and* ensure you comply with the source license.\n\n---\n\n### Example: Supposing you copied it\n\n```r\n#' Find closest value in a sorted vector [sourced from dplyr]\n#'\n#' [original description]\n#' @keywords internal\nclosest <- function(x, table) {\n  # function body from dplyr\n}\n```\n\n**Document** in roxygen where you sourced it and under what license.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Method                | Acceptable for Package? | Notes                                        |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| `dplyr::fun()`        | **Yes**                | Only for exported functions                  |\n| `dplyr:::fun()`       | **NO**                 | Will be flagged by R CMD check & CRAN        |\n| `fun()` (unqualified) | **NO**                 | Only works in dev or interactive, not robust |\n| Copy function         | Yes (with license)     | Attribute; maintain if dplyr changes         |\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \n> Replace or copy the unexported function, don't use it directly/from dplyr.

Instead, it:\n\n1. Assumes `closest()` is a non-exported internal function that shouldn't be used\n2. Recommends avoiding the function entirely\n3. Suggests copying the function code\n4.
