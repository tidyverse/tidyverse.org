```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>"
)
```

[rlang 0.4.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/06/rlang-0-4-0/) introduced the curly-curly `{{` operator to simplify writing functions around tidyverse pipelines. The minor update 0.4.3 of rlang makes it possible to use `{` and `{{` to create result names in tidyverse verbs taking pairs of names and expressions.

Install the latest version of rlang to make the new feature globally available throughout the tidyverse:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rlang")
```


## Tunnelling data-variables with curly-curly

With the `{{` operator you can __tunnel__ data-variables (i.e. columns from the data frames) through arg-variables (function arguments):

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mean_by <- function(data, by, var) {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ by }}) %>%
    summarise(avg = mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE))
}
```

The tunnel makes it possible to supply variables from the data frame to your wrapper function:

```{r}
iris %>% mean_by(Species, Sepal.Width)
```

Without a tunnel, the ambiguity between data-variables and arg-variables causes R to complain about objects not found:

```{r, error = TRUE}
mean_by_no_tunnel <- function(data, by, var) {
  data %>%
    group_by(by) %>%
    summarise(avg = mean(var, na.rm = TRUE))
}

iris %>% mean_by_no_tunnel(Species, Sepal.Width)
```

That's because of the ambiguity between the function argument `by` and the data-variable `Species`. R has no way of knowing that you meant the variable from the data frame.


## Custom result names

In the example above, the result name is hard-coded to `avg`. This is an informative generic name, but returning a more specific name that reflects the context might make the function more helpful. For this reason, tidy eval functions taking dots (like `dplyr::mutate()`, `dplyr::group_by()`, or `dplyr::summarise()`) now support glue strings as result names.

Glue strings are implemented in the [glue package](https://glue.tidyverse.org/). They are a flexible way of composing a string from components, interpolating R code within the string:

```{r}
library(glue)

name <- "Bianca"
glue("The result of `1 + 2` is {1 + 2}, so says {name}.")
```

You can now use glue strings in result names. Note that for technical reasons you need the Walrus operator `:=` instead of the usual `=`.

```{r}
suffix <- "foo"
iris %>% summarise("prefix_{suffix}" := mean(Sepal.Width))
```

In addition to normal glue interpolation with `{`, you can also tunnel data-variables through function arguments with `{{` inside the string:

```{r}
mean_by <- function(data, by, var) {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ by }}) %>%
    summarise("{{ var }}" := mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE))
}

iris %>% mean_by(Species, Sepal.Width)
```

And you can combine both forms of interpolation in a same glue string:

```{r}
mean_by <- function(data, by, var, prefix = "avg") {
  data %>%
    group_by({{ by }}) %>%
    summarise("{prefix}_{{ var }}" := mean({{ var }}, na.rm = TRUE))
}

iris %>% mean_by(Species, Sepal.Width)
```

You can learn more about tunnelling variables in [this RStudio::conf 2020 talk](https://speakerdeck.com/lionelhenry/interactivity-and-programming-in-the-tidyverse).
