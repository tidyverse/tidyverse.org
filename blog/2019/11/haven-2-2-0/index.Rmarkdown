```

We're delighted to announce that [haven 2.2.0](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) is now on CRAN. haven enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages by wrapping the [ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat) C library written by [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/). 

You can install haven from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("haven")
```

This release features big improvements thanks to the hard work of [Mikko Marttila](https://github.com/mikmart): all `read_*()` functions gain three new arguments that allow you to read in only part of a large file. I'll quickly show of these features by saving out the [`diamonds`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) dataset to a Stata file:

```{r}
library(haven)
write_dta(ggplot2::diamonds, "diamonds.dta")
```

`n_max` and `skip` allow you to read in just a portion of the rows:

```{r}
read_dta("diamonds.dta", n_max = 5)
read_dta("diamonds.dta", skip = 4, n_max = 5)
```

And `col_select()` allows you to read in just some of the columns, using the same syntax that you use with [`dplyr::select()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html):

```{r}
read_dta("diamonds.dta", col_select = c(x:z))

read_dta("diamonds.dta", col_select = starts_with("c"))
```

These features allow you to read in datasets that would otherwise not fit in memory, and should substantially improve performance when you only need a few rows or columns from a large file.

This release includes a number of other bug fixes and small improvements, see the [changelog](https://haven.tidyverse.org/news/index.html) for a complete list.
