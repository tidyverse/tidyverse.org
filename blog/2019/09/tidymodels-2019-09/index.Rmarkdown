We've sent a few packages to CRAN recently. Here's a recap of the changes (and some notes at the bottom): 

## recipes 0.1.6
 
### Breaking Changes

 * Since 2018, a warning has been issued when the wrong argument was used in `bake(recipe, newdata)`. The deprecation period is over and `new_data` is officially required.  
 * Previously, if [`step_other()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_other.html) did _not_ collapse any levels, it would still add an "other" level to the factor. This would lump new factor levels into "other" when data were baked (as  [`step_novel()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_novel.html) does). This no longer occurs, since it was inconsistent with `?step_other`, which said that: "If no pooling is done the data are unmodified".
 
### New Operations:

*  [`step_normalize()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_normalize.html) centers and scales the data (if you are, like Max, too lazy to use two separate steps). 
*  [`step_unknown()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_unknown.html) will convert missing data in categorical columns to "unknown" and update factor levels. 
 
### Other Changes:

* If the `threshold` argument of [`step_other()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_other.html) is greater than one, it specifies the minimum sample size before the levels of the factor are collapsed into the "other" category. [#289](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/289)
*  [`step_knnimpute()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_knnimpute.html) can now pass two options to the underlying knn code, including the number of threads ([#323](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/323)). 
* Due to changes by CRAN,  [`step_nnmf()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_nnmf.html) only works on versions of R >= 3.6.0 due to dependency issues. 
*  [`step_dummy()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_dummy.html) and [`step_other()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_other.html) are now tolerant to cases where that step's selectors do not capture any columns. In this case, no modifications to the data are made. ([#290](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/290), [#348](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/348))
*  [`step_dummy()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_dummy.html) can now retain the original columns that are used to make the dummy variables by setting `preserve = TRUE`. ([#328](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/328)) 
*  [`step_other()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_other.html)'s print method only reports the variables with collapsed levels (as opposed to any column that was _tested_ to see if it needed collapsing). ([#338](https://github.com/tidymodels/recipes/issues/338)) 
*  [`step_pca()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_pca.html),  [`step_kpca()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_kpca.html),  [`step_ica()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_ica.html),  [`step_nnmf()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_nnmf.html),  [`step_pls()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_pls.html), and  [`step_isomap()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/reference/step_isomap.html) now accept zero components. In this case, the original data are returned. Please use this with great care. 
 
## embed 0.0.3

Two new steps were added:

 * [`step_umap()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/embed/reference/step_umap.html) was added for both supervised and unsupervised encodings. 
 * [`step_woe()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/embed/reference/step_woe.html) creates weight of evidence encodings. Thanks to Athos Petri Damiani for this. 

## rsample 0.0.5

* Added three functions to compute different [bootstrap confidence intervals](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/articles/Applications/Intervals.html). 
* A new function ([`add_resample_id()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/add_resample_id.html)) augments a data frame with columns for the resampling identifier. 
* Updated [`initial_split()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/initial_split.html), [`mc_cv()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/mc_cv.html), [`vfold_cv()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/vfold_cv.html), [`bootstraps()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/bootstraps.html), and [`group_vfold_cv()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/group_vfold_cv.html) to use tidyselect on the stratification variable.
* Updated [`initial_split()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/initial_split.html), [`mc_cv()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/mc_cv.html), [`vfold_cv()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/vfold_cv.html), and  [`bootstraps()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/bootstraps.html) with new `breaks` parameter that specifies the number of bins to stratify by for a numeric stratification variable.

## parsnip 0.0.3.1

Unplanned release based on CRAN requirements for Solaris.

### Breaking Changes

 * The method that `parsnip` uses to store the model information has changed. Any custom models from previous versions will need to use the new method for registering models. The methods are detailed in `?get_model_env` and the [package vignette for adding models](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Scratch.html).

 * The mode needs to be declared for models that can be used for more than one mode prior to fitting and/or translation. 

 * For `surv_reg()`, the engine that uses the `survival` package is now called `survival` instead of `survreg`.  

 * For `glmnet` models, the full regularization path is always fit regardless of the value given to `penalty`. Previously, the model was fit by passing `penalty` to `glmnet`'s `lambda` argument, and the model could only make predictions at those specific values. [(#195)](https://github.com/tidymodels/parsnip/issues/195)

### New Features

 * `add_rowindex()` can create a column called `.row` to a data frame. 
 
 * If a computational engine is not explicitly set, a default will be used. Each default is documented on the corresponding model page. A warning is issued at fit time unless verbosity is zero.  

 * `nearest_neighbor()` gained a `multi_predict` method. The `multi_predict()` documentation is a little better organized.  
 
 * A suite of internal functions were added to help with upcoming model tuning features.  

 * A `parsnip` object always saved the name(s) of the outcome variable(s) for proper naming of the predicted values. 


## corrr 0.4

### New features

* New function called [`dice()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/corrr/reference/dice.html) function, wraps `focus(x,..., mirror = TRUE)`
* A new [`retract()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/corrr/reference/retract.html) function does the opposite of `stretch()` 
* A new argument was added to [`stretch()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/corrr/reference/stretch.html) called `remove.dups`. It removes duplicates with out removing all NAs. 

### Improvements

* `correlate()`'s interface for databases was improved. It now only calculates unique pairs, and simplifies the formula that ultimately runs in-database. We also re-added the vignette to the package, which is also available on the site as an [article](https://tidymodels.github.io/corrr/articles/databases.html)

## tidypredict 0.4.3

### New models

The new version is now able to parse the following models:

  * `cubist()`, from the `Cubist` package
  * `ctree()`, from the `partykit` package
  * XGBoost trained models, via the `xgboost` package

### New features

* Integration with `broom`'s `tidy()` function. It works with Regression models only
* Adds support for `parsnip` fitted models: `lm`, `randomForest`, `ranger`, and `earth`
* Adds [`as_parsed_model()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/reference/as_parsed_model.html) function. It adds the proper class components to the list. This allows any model exported in the correct spec to be read in by `tidypredict`. See the [Save Models](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/articles/save.html) and [Non-R models](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/articles/non-r.html) for more information

### Improvements

* Now supports classification models from `ranger`

### Website

The package's [official website](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/index.html) has been expanded greatly. Here are some highlights:

  * An article per each supported model, they are found under Model List
  * A how to guide to save and reload models, [link here](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/articles/save.html) 
  * How to integrate non-R models to `tidypredict`, [link here](https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/articles/non-r.html) 

## yardstick 0.0.4

### New Metrics

Two new metrics have been added to yardstick:

* [`iic()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/reference/iic.html) is a numeric metric for computing the index of ideality of correlation. It is a potential alternative to the traditional correlation coefficient, and has been used in QSAR models ([#115](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick/issues/87)).
* [`average_precision()`](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/reference/average_precision.html) is a probability metric that can be used as an alternative to `pr_auc()`. It has the benefit of avoiding any issues of ambiguity in the edge case where `recall == 0` and the current number of false positives is `0`.

### Improvements

* `pr_curve()` (and by extension `pr_auc()`) has been greatly improved to better handle edge cases when duplicate class probability values are present. Additionally, the first precision value in the curve is now a `1`, rather than an `NA`, which results in a more practical curve, and generates a more correct AUC value ([#93](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick/issues/93)).
* Each metric function now has a `direction` attribute, which specifies the direction required for optimization, either minimization or maximization.
* Documentation for class probability metrics has been improved with more informative examples ([#100](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick/issues/100)).
* `mn_log_loss()` now uses the min/max rule before computing the log of the estimated probabilities to avoid problematic undefined log values ([#103](https://github.com/tidymodels/yardstick/issues/103)).

## Upcoming Changes and Directions

We are currently working on two general use packages: `workflows` and `tune`. The former bundles together recipes, model object, and other items so that there can be single `fit()` and `predict()` methods. `tune` will have tools for... um... tuning models. We are hoping to make these public in the next month or so. 

There will be some changes to accommodate model tuning. The `dials` package has been re-factored substantially (see the current GH master branch) and there were some small interfaces changes to `recipes` too (mostly backwards compatible and also on GH). We are pretty close to end of "Phase I" of our tidymodels work.
