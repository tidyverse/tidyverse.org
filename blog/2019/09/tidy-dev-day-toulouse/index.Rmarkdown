We had our second official [tidyverse developer
day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/04/tidyverse-dev-day-at-user-2019/)
just before [useR! 2019](http://www.user2019.fr/) in Toulouse. It was a fun day, and we managed to merge around **40** pull
requests on the day, and [nearly **30** more](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+label%3A%22tidy-dev-day+%3Anerd_face%3A%22+created%3A%3E2019-07-07+is%3Amerged&type=Issues) afterwards. You can learn more about the experience in the words of attendees [Laura
Acion](https://lacion.rbind.io/post/my-first-user/) and [Dragos
Moldovan-Grünfeld](https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/user2019-roundup-workflow-reproducibility-and-friends).

``` {r, echo = FALSE}

```

The event was particularly successful thanks to a few changes we made after our 
[first try](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/):

  - `r emo::ji("handshake")` **Helpers** The goal of TDD is to provide 
    opportunities for everyone to contribute, regardless of their level of 
    expertise. This time we made sure to recruit plenty of helpers (~20 for 
    ~70 participants) and to clearly identify them with snazzy nametags. Having 
    friendly faces circulating and ready to lend a hand made the event much 
    warmer for newcomers (and helping others is pretty satisfying, too).
  
  - `r emo::ji("label")` **Post-its** Searching GitHub issues for a problem you
    can help solve is hard enough at the best of times, but it's darn near 
    impossible when you're competing with a room full of people. To make it
    easier we went back to the basics and paired every GitHub issue with a 
    colour-coded sticky note. This made it much easier to find issues, and 
    as a side-benefit made it possible to see collective progress over the day 
    as post-its migrated from `To Do` to `Under Review` to `Done`.
  
  - `r emo::ji("bellhop")` **The gong** Getting your PR merged is a cause for
    celebration, and Hadley likes to travel with a gong. It was only natural 
    to combine these two truths by ringing the gong every time a PR was merged!
 
We will be hosting our next tidyverse dev day on **January 31st** in San
Francisco, following [rstudio::conf(2020)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/).
We haven't yet finalized a venue, but it'll be convenient to the conference 
location.
