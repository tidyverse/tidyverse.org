```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

We are pleased to announce that [forcats 0.4.0](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/) is now on CRAN. 
The forcats package provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors in R. This version benefited from the hard work of contributors new and old at our first [tidyverse dev day](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/).  For a complete set of changes, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

To install the latest version, run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("forcats")
```

As always, attach the package with:

```{r}
library(forcats)
```


## New functions

[`fct_cross()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_cross.html) creates a new factor containing the combined levels from two or more input factors, similar to `base::interaction()`.  

```{r}
fruit <- factor(c("apple", "kiwi", "apple", "apple"))
colour <- factor(c("green", "green", "red", "green"))
fct_cross(fruit, colour)
```

[`fct_lump_min()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_lump.html) preserves levels that appear at least `min` times (can also be used with the `w` weighted argument).  
 
```{r}
x <- factor(letters[rpois(50, 3)])
fct_lump_min(x, min = 10)
```


[`fct_match()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_match.html) tests for the presence of levels in a factor, providing a safer alternative to `%in%` by throwing an error when there are unexpected levels.
 
```{r error = TRUE}
table(fct_match(gss_cat$marital, c("Married", "Divorced")))
table(gss_cat$marital %in% c("Maried", "Davorced"))
table(fct_match(gss_cat$marital, c("Maried", "Davorced")))
```

## Other improvements

* [`fct_relevel()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html) can now relevel factors using a function that is passed the current levels.  
 
    ```{r}
    f <- factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), levels = c("b", "c", "d", "a"))
    fct_relevel(f, sort)
    fct_relevel(f, rev)
    ```

* [`as_factor()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/as_factor.html) now has a numeric method which orders factors in numeric order, unlike the other methods which default to order of appearance.

    ```{r}
    y <- c("1.1", "11", "2.2", "22")
    as_factor(y)
    z <- as.numeric(y)
    as_factor(z)
    ```

* [`fct_inseq()`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/fct_inorder.html) reorders labels numerically, when possible.

Thanks to Emily Robinson, forcats also has a new [introductory vignette](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/articles/forcats.html).
