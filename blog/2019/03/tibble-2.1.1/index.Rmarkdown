Version 2.1.1 of the *tibble* package is on CRAN now. Tibbles are a modern reimagining of the data frame, keeping what time has shown to be effective, and throwing out what is not, with nicer default output too! Grab the latest version with:

```r
install.packages("tibble")
```

This release mostly focuses on the name repair introduced in *tibble* 2.0.1.
We have specific regrets about one aspect of name repair and we think the pros of fixing it outweigh the cons:
when a column name is completely absent, the numbered suffix we add becomes the entire name.
Originally, we chose `..j` (two dots and a number).
However, that produces names that require special handling, because names of the form `..j` have a special meaning: they are reserved words, you can assign them a value but not query them.

```{r assign-dot-dot, error = TRUE}
..2 <- 5
..2
```


The ability to query a value by name is very important for data frames in general and especially for the tidy evaluation framework:

```{r tidy-dot-dot}
df <- tibble(`..1` = "not ok", .name_repair = "minimal")
with(df, `..1`)
dplyr::select(df, `..1`)
```

Since name repair is often something that happens automatically, we think it's best to suffix with `...j` (three dots and a number) and leave people with names that are easier to work with.

```{r repair}
as_tibble(list(1, 2, 3), .name_repair = "unique")
```

Existing names of the form `..j` (and also `...`) are repaired too:

```{r repair-dots}
tibble(... = "a", ..1 = "b", .name_repair = "unique")
```

By extension, this means that names of this form are rejected unless you specify a name repair strategy:

```{r repair-dots-minimal}
tibble(..1 = "a")
tibble(..1 = "a", .name_repair = "minimal")
```

For consistency, three dots are used for all disambiguating suffixes, not only for empty names.

This might affect you if you use *readxl* or another package that uses the new name repair, and we're sorry for the disruption.
We're confident that a bit of short-term pain now is better than the agony that would have come from the existent behavior.
Also, name repair currently is in the "maturing" lifecycle,
