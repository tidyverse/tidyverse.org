```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(haven)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE, 
  comment = "#>", 
  fig.width = 7, 
  fig.align = 'center',
  fig.asp = 0.618, # 1 / phi
  out.width = "700px"
)
```

We're delighted to announce that [haven 2.1.0](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) is now on CRAN. haven enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages by wrapping the [ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat) C library written by [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/). For a full account of updates in this release, see the [Changelog](https://haven.tidyverse.org/news/index.html).

## Improved labelling 

Both [`labelled()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled.html) and [`labelled_spss()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html) now allow `NULL` labels. This makes both classes more flexible, allowing you to use them for their other attributes.`labelled()` also now tests that value labels are unique.


`labelled` objects now get pretty printing that shows the labels and `NA` values when inside of a `tbl_df`. You can turn this behaviour off by using `option(haven.show_pillar_labels = FALSE)`. 

```{r haven-labelled}
tibble::tibble(s = haven::labelled(c(1, 10), labels = c("A" = 1, "B" = 10)))
```


## Minor improvements and fixes

This release is updated to the latest version of Evan Miller's [ReadStat](https://github.com/WizardMac/ReadStat), which includes the following changes:

 * [`read_por()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) can now read files from SPSS 25.  
 * [`read_por()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) uses base-10 instead of base-30 for the exponent.  
 * [`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) can read zero-column files.  
 * [`read_sav()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) now reads long strings, and has greater memory limit, allowing it to read more labels.  
 * [`read_spss()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) reads long variable labels.  
 * [`write_sav()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) no longer creates incorrect column names when >10k columns.
 * [`write_sav()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_spss.html) no longer crashes when writing long label names.
