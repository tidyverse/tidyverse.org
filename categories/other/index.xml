&lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/r_docs/R-package/docs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xgboost&lt;/a> library has recently gotten a big CRAN release. Jumping from version 1.7.11.1 to 3.1.2.1. We at the tidymodels team have been following the development and have done our best to ensure that your experience is unaffected by this release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to all the new features and improvements that are now available for users relying on CRAN versions of packages, there are also a few breaking changes. Specifically between version 1.x and 2.x of the xgboost library. The xgboost team has kindly provided a
&lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/R-package/migration_guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migration guide&lt;/a> for how to update your code if you are upgrading from before version 2.x.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are using xgboost purely through tidymodels via functions like
&lt;a href="https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/boost_tree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>parsnip::boost_tree()&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://embed.tidymodels.org/reference/step_discretize_xgb.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>embed::step_discretize_xgb()&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, you should not need to change anything, as we have updated our packages to work with both the new and old versions of xgboost. If you are having any issues, please let us know by filing an issue for the affected package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We look forward to integrating parsnip more deeply into these new changes, such as support for
&lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/categorical.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">categorical predictors&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/examples/quantile_regression.html#quantile-regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantile regression&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Since deep learning models already have extensive support in Python, our focus is on the analysis and modeling of &lt;em>tabular data&lt;/em>. Our primary goal is to develop packages that enhance the existing capabilities of frameworks such as scikit-learn. Note that the current position doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve building or publishing models created here; &lt;em>this is a pure package developer role&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We think that the tidymodels
&lt;a href="https://www.tmwr.org/software-modeling#fundamentals-for-modeling-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy&lt;/a> can enhance modeling in Python, and we believe that learning more about modeling in Python will provide us with ideas on how to improve tidymodels. To clarify, we are not creating a tidymodels Python package; however, some of its APIs may be beneficial to Python users. Two examples are
&lt;a href="https://recipes.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipes&lt;/a> and broom&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://broom.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidy and augment&lt;/a> verbs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are numerous ways that individuals can contribute to improving the Python ecosystem. We have a lot of ideas, but we also want to know what our new hire believes is most important. A sample of potential projects that have been on our mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Grid search for model tuning has a fairly bad reputation for being inefficient. However, space-filling designs (SFDs) are excellent tools for making small tuning grids that methodically cover the entire parameter space. Users would benefit from having an integrated tool that can create grids from their pipelines using optimal SFDs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>There are occasions where we might decline to produce a prediction, perhaps due to our prediction data being extrapolations from the training set. &lt;em>Applicability Domain&lt;/em> methods measure extrapolation and can help determine where the model&amp;rsquo;s predictions are likely to be poor. An API that can take a model object and the training set could generate a score that informs users when their predictions are &lt;del>hallucinated&lt;/del> unlikely to be accurate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Python deserves an original (Python-only) implementation of the popular
&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C7&amp;amp;q=Regularization&amp;#43;Paths&amp;#43;for&amp;#43;Generalized&amp;#43;Linear&amp;#43;Models&amp;#43;via&amp;#43;Coordinate&amp;#43;Descent&amp;amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glmnet model&lt;/a>. There are Python libraries that wrap the original Fortran code; however, this approach isn&amp;rsquo;t easily supported, nor is it able to facilitate the numerous extensions of this particular model (e.g.,
&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C7&amp;amp;q=%22A&amp;#43;sparse-group&amp;#43;lasso%22&amp;amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">group-wise penalties&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0%2C7&amp;amp;q=%22Nearly&amp;#43;unbiased&amp;#43;variable&amp;#43;selection&amp;#43;under&amp;#43;minimax&amp;#43;concave&amp;#43;penalty%22&amp;amp;btnG=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MCP&lt;/a> penalties, etc). This would be a substantial and in-depth project.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We have about a dozen other project ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open-source developers at Posit often have a broader role than just writing and testing code. We are often the folks defining what is deemed important and prioritizing our work. Additionally, we frequently undertake tasks that are typically considered part of developer relations, such as reaching out to the community, creating additional technical content, speaking at conferences, and teaching workshops. If you are a driven and independent developer, you might be interested in this position. You&amp;rsquo;ll have a lot of agency here and in an environment that encourages quality. Our developers tend to feel a personal stake in our work and want it to be as good as it can be. We&amp;rsquo;re a completely remote team, flexible in terms of how and when we work, and we do a good job of minimizing administrative overhead for engineers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The 2025 Tidy Dev Day will be on September 19th! We&amp;rsquo;ll gather after posit::conf near the conference venue (see the link to the event page at the bottom).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tidy Dev Day (TDD) is an event where developers and open source contributors meet to collaboratively solve issues. You can hone your software engineering skills or work on your first contribution. We will have a slate of existing issues that you can work on with or without the assistance of our developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how
&lt;a href="https://lacion.rbind.io/post/my-first-user/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Acion&lt;/a> described the 2019 event:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I wish there were more of these R-related dev days. Developing events that are friendly, diverse, and safe to advance not only the tidyverse. I see no downsides. Kudos to the organizers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Plus&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong> have to have an extensive development background or experience solving issues, or making pull requests. You do need a GitHub account, and some git experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leading up to TDD, we will hold (optional) virtual &amp;ldquo;office hours&amp;rdquo; for TDD participants to help you with your Git workflow so that you can stroll into TDD confident that your R, Git, GitHub, and IDE are set up in the most ideal way possible to work in harmony on your laptop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello there! I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on ggplot2 for a while now, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to tell you how that came about and what it is like.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-i-got-involved">How I got involved
&lt;a href="#how-i-got-involved">
&lt;svg class="anchor-symbol" aria-hidden="true" height="26" width="26" viewBox="0 0 22 22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
&lt;path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="currentColor">&lt;/path>
&lt;path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76.0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71.0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71.0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76.0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z">&lt;/path>
&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>My journey into learning R started in 2017 during an internship at the EMBL-EBI. The main gripe about base R plotting that drove me into ggplot2&amp;rsquo;s arms were the arcane invocations to get anything else than one of the pre-approved chart types. In contrast, ggplot2 absorbs a bunch of small paper cuts, is very compositional in nature while remaining highly customisable. In a bid to &amp;ldquo;learn from the mistakes of others&amp;rdquo; rather than (continue to copiously) make my own, I became active on Stack Overflow answering questions and solving plotting issues. For posterity: this was in the days before you could ask an large language model for personalised advice and actual humans were equally frustrated on both sides of the question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was keeping track of solutions to common problems in a personal cookbook that had its own arcane invocations. To give a bit of flavour: much of the cookbook was about preparing gtables (the data structure that comes out of building a plot) for combining and aligning plots. &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> The cookbook eventually grew into my first ggplot2 extension package:
&lt;a href="https://teunbrand.github.io/ggh4x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ggh4x&lt;/a>. Perhaps that package would be best subtitled: &amp;lsquo;Remedies to my common ggplot2 ailments&amp;rsquo;. It contains a bunch of miscellaneous functions ranging from reorganising facets to putting minor ticks on the axes. The nature of the package was also its downside, as ggh4x lacked any sense of scope (and still does, as befits any first package).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around the time when I was really getting into ggplot extensions,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/EvaMaeRey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gina Reynolds&lt;/a> had started organising a meeting for people who build ggplot2 extensions. It is an interesting place to meet others and hear about their packages and how they face interacting with the ggplot2 extension system. I started attending with some degree of regularity and made a discussion place on GitHub. We now use this for general exchange of ideas, but also package specific issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, the questions on Stack Overflow kept directing my attention at the ggplot2 issue tracker every once in a while. After lurking in there for a bit, I started my first informal contributions to ggplot2 itself by answering the simple stuff just as I did on Stack Overflow. It may not seem like much of a contribution, but in retrospect, answering issues helps triaging them: it separates those issues that need additional changes in ggplot2 from those that do not. My first &amp;lsquo;proper contribution&amp;rsquo; in the shape of a pull request was in 2020. It replaced 3 lines of code with 2 lines of code to benefit type stability (this was prior to
&lt;a href="https://vctrs.r-lib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vctrs&lt;/a>)&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022, I commented &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to take a stab at this&amp;rdquo; on an issue proposing a large refactor of the guide system. I like to think it was this precise moment that Thomas, the project lead after having taken over for Hadley, took notice and later invited me to join the team&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This new guide system ended up laying the foundation for
&lt;a href="https://teunbrand.github.io/legendry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legendry&lt;/a>, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely out of unselfish reasons that I volunteered. At any rate, this is a great opportunity to fill big shoes on a major R project, so I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to have joined!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="becoming-an-insider">Becoming an insider
&lt;a href="#becoming-an-insider">

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Part of being on the team is straightforward. You triage issues. You fix bugs. You implement new features. At the point that I joined, I had already done these things as an outsider. The only thing that really changes is that you get the keys to the kingdom: you can now close issues and merge pull requests &lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. You&amp;rsquo;re then trusted to wield this power wisely. You then hope you do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time I joined the most active maintainers were Thomas, Claus and Hiroaki. I was surprised to learn that really most communication happens on GitHub and it is all public discussion. Even more abstract coordination that does not neatly fit into a single issue, like preparing a new release, didn&amp;rsquo;t occur behind closed doors. I think what made my introduction to the team more awkward than it needed to be was that GitHub issues is not really a good place for announcements where you can say &amp;lsquo;Hi everyone, this person is on the team now and will be doing stuff in the project&amp;rsquo;. I had interacted with the other active maintainers before, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a completely alien actor, but I felt some unclarity lingered longer than it ought have. Perhaps I should more assertively have introduced myself &lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, by the time posit::conf(2024) was over, I&amp;rsquo;ve met 6 out of the 9 other authors in person. I have more thoughts about conf and my first time in the United States, but it has been amazing to meet all these people in person whose work you&amp;rsquo;ve been admiring for a while!&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The ggplot2 package has both the blessing and the curse of being a popular package. One the one hand, it is a blessing that people care about the project, post issues that they find and make intermittent contributions. The curse is that it is such a staple in the R ecosystem, that almost any change will inadvertently affect somebody else&amp;rsquo;s code. Not only because ggplot2 is widely used, but also because people have been &amp;hellip;creative&amp;hellip; with how they are using ggplot2. The art of making changes is to largely affect plots in a good way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first big project I was rummaging through was the guide system I proposed to rewrite. The guide system had never been advertised as an official extension point, but naturally that didn&amp;rsquo;t preclude people from using it as an extension point anyway.&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> So in addition to rewriting the system, we also had to prevent terribly breaking extensions that relied on the old system. In some cases, this meant sending out PRs to other packages to be compatible with both systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having worked through a good number of issues at this point in time, I can see some emergent patterns. Different patterns can be partially explained by different audiences. The regular user wants to be empowered to execute their vision of a plot effectively. Maintainers of extensions would often like things to work consistently or change a very obscure line somewhere that they have identified as blocking a niche use case. Teachers would like their students to get stuck less often, which often involves improving error messages. All in all, there is no shortage of issues to work through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next big thing we&amp;rsquo;re working on is some practical necromancy in getting themeable aesthetics resurrected, which was
&lt;a href="https://www.danaseidel.com/2018-09-01-ATidySummer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initiated by Dana Paige Seidel&lt;/a> all the way back in 2018! We&amp;rsquo;d like the theme to be a home for more default choices than just non-data elements. Default layer aesthetics are a start, but we plan on putting in default palettes too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve had eight previous summer interns and these led to the creation of a number of new packages:

&lt;p>This year, the primary focus is on expanding our feature selection capabilities. Some of this will involve new recipe steps and other functions. Towards the end of the internship, there might be time to work on other things, too!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To apply, make sure that you have a GitHub handle and follow this link:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At the end of 2021, we created a survey to get community input on how we prioritize our projects.
&lt;a href="https://colorado.posit.co/rsc/tidymodels-priorities-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The results&lt;/a> gave us a good sense of which items people were most interested in. Since then we have completed a number of projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Model fairness metrics&lt;/strong> were included in
&lt;a href="https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/news/index.html#yardstick-130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yardstick 1.3.0&lt;/a> with
&lt;a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidymodels.org&lt;/a> posts coming soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Spatial analysis models and methods&lt;/strong> led to the creation of
&lt;a href="https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatialsample&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>H2O.ai support&lt;/strong> was achieved with the creation of
&lt;a href="https://agua.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agua&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Better serialization tools&lt;/strong> are now provided in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bundle&lt;/a> package.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Almost everything that respondents prioritized highly last year has either been completed or is currently in progress. Our main focus right now is to wrap up survival analysis, which is being done right now with a series of CRAN releases for the affected packages. Most immediately following these releases, we will be working on postprocessing and supervised feature selection. Beyond that, we&amp;rsquo;d like to once again ask the community for feedback to help us better prioritize features in the coming year.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://conjoint.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWw8ocGN5aPgeZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our survey for next priorities&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> and let us know what you think. There are some items we&amp;rsquo;ve put &amp;ldquo;on the menu&amp;rdquo; but you can write in other items that you are interested in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current slate of our possible priorities include:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sparse-tibbles">Sparse tibbles
&lt;a href="#sparse-tibbles">
&lt;svg class="anchor-symbol" aria-hidden="true" height="26" width="26" viewBox="0 0 22 22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Many models benefit from having sparse data, both in execution time and memory usage. We can&amp;rsquo;t take full advantage of this since recipes use tibbles. This project would involve making it so the tibbles used &lt;em>inside of a recipe&lt;/em> can hold sparse data. This would not be intended as a general substitute for regular tibbles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="causal-inference-interface">Causal inference interface

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>While many common causal inference workflows are already possible with tidymodels, a small set of helper functions could greatly ease the experience of causal modeling in the framework. Specifically, these changes would better accommodate a two-stage modeling approach, using predictions from a propensity model to set case weights for an outcome model.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mlverse/chattr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chattr&lt;/a> is an interface to large language models (LLMs). It enables interaction with the model directly from the RStudio IDE. This task would involve fine-tuning it to give better results when used for tidymodels tasks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When Spring arrives in the Northern hemisphere, the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays reach into the dark corners and illuminate the dust that has been gathering over the winter. This is when our thoughts start to turn to Spring cleaning &amp;mdash; a time to clear out the clutter that has accumulated over the past year. It represents a fresh start and a new beginning, and leaves us feeling rejuvenated and ready to take on the rest of the year. This applies not only to our homes, but also to the code that we maintain &amp;mdash; there are often bits and pieces that we know need attention but never seem to make it to the top of the priority list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doing this kind of work isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily only about adopting good practices or increasing the quality of your code &amp;mdash; it can also be about adding value through standardization. Most developers only work sporadically on a particular package. For some it&amp;rsquo;s because they work on a lot of packages, while for many it&amp;rsquo;s because package development is not their main job. When you return to a package after a long gap, there is potential for a lot of friction (and dread/procrastination) as you get re-oriented to its idiosyncrasies. Making the occasional pass through your packages and looking for opportunities to adopt current, shared practices can make it easier to dip in and out of different packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tidyverse team at Posit has a practice of tackling Spring Cleaning together - we set aside a week every year to work in a semi-structured way to efficiently take care of a common list of package maintenance tasks. We find that setting a time for them and doing them all together during one week is an effective, and more fun, way to get them done. We recently completed our 2023 Spring Cleaning and thought it might be fun to share our process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll also show off a new feature we&amp;rsquo;ve built in to the
&lt;a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/news/index.html#usethis-220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest version of usethis&lt;/a> that will help you organize your own Spring Cleaning. Feel free to

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Early in the new year, we set aside the time in our calendars for Spring Cleaning &amp;mdash; this way everyone knows that it&amp;rsquo;s coming up and can make sure they have cleared the space in their schedules (and their minds) to focus on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We prepare for the week by creating a list of things we want to take care of in our packages. Rather than adding features or fixing bugs, these tasks are usually about bringing things up to current standards or best practices, and include things like updating tests to the latest testthat version, updating pkgdown templates, and adding alt-text to images in pkgdown sites. Not surprisingly, this year a lot of the upkeep was related to our
&lt;a href="https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-now-posit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent rebrand from RStudio to Posit&lt;/a> &amp;mdash; things like updating the copyright holder and author email addresses, and using updated logos without the old rstudio.com website on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start off the week with a kickoff meeting on Monday morning. We go through the checklist with everybody and refine what&amp;rsquo;s in it, making sure everybody has had input. Because we maintain so many packages, we have a spreadsheet where we keep track of the packages that are undergoing spring cleaning, and people can assign themselves to packages and mark them as completed when they&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="checklists-checklists-checklists">Checklists, checklists, checklists

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We formalize these tasks into a checklist (
&lt;a href="https://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love checklists&lt;/a>) via a tidyverse-focused function in usethis called &lt;code>use_tidy_upkeep_issue()&lt;/code>. If you&amp;rsquo;re a package developer and you use
&lt;a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_release_issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>use_release_issue()&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, this will look familiar: it opens an issue in the package&amp;rsquo;s GitHub repository with a checklist of tasks to guide us through what needs to be done to bring it up to current tidyverse standards. We update the function with the current year&amp;rsquo;s checklist just prior to starting (and sometimes during) Spring Cleaning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Package maintainers then install the development version of usethis to get the current checklist, and call &lt;code>usethis::use_tidy_upkeep_issue()&lt;/code> in their package to create the issue. If there are any tasks that aren&amp;rsquo;t relevant to that particular repo it&amp;rsquo;s easy to just edit the issue and remove it. To be really meta, here is the 2023 Spring Cleaning
&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1791" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upkeep issue for usethis&lt;/a>, created by usethis:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We separated the tasks into &amp;ldquo;Necessary&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Optional&amp;rdquo;. The necessary tasks were those we needed to complete for all of our packages, and also were simple enough that we could be sure we would able to complete them. The optional items were those that were nice to have, and/or would take longer to complete. We try to complete the work, including reviewing and merging any related
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidymodels/dials/pull/275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull requests&lt;/a>, all within the week, with the intention of closing the upkeep issue by Friday.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we end the week with a wrap-up meeting - we do a retrospective on what worked, what didn&amp;rsquo;t, and what we would change for next time. For example, we found that a couple of items on this year&amp;rsquo;s checklist that were too complex to complete within the week, especially across many repos. So we decided to start a practice of converting those &amp;ldquo;too big&amp;rdquo; tasks into issues of their own &amp;mdash; you can see an example in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testthat upkeep issue&lt;/a>. This makes it more likely that we can cleanly complete the checklist but still flag those lingering things we would like to finish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also try to have a little fun during the wrap-up meeting! I made a small R package called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ateucher/chatrbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatrbox&lt;/a> that uses
&lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT&lt;/a> to generate R-themed Spring Cleaning text snippets. And Tracy Teal used
&lt;a href="https://quarto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarto&lt;/a> to make certificates of achievement for each of us, complete with inspirational messages made with chatrbox!&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In
&lt;a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/news/index.html#usethis-220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.2.0 of usethis&lt;/a>, we have created a general purpose
&lt;a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_upkeep_issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>use_upkeep_issue()&lt;/code>&lt;/a> function for package authors to use if they wish to do a Spring Cleaning of their own. It is a fairly opinionated list of tasks but we believe taking care of them will generally make your package better, easier to maintain, and more enjoyable for your users. Some of the tasks are meant to be performed only once (and once completed shouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up in subsequent lists), and some should be reviewed periodically. If you want to include additional tasks, you can add an (unexported) function named &lt;code>upkeep_bullets()&lt;/code> to your own package that returns a character vector of tasks. These will be added to your upkeep checklist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of an upkeep issue I created for my package rmapshaper. I created an internal function &lt;code>upkeep_bullets()&lt;/code> in the package, with an extra bullet I wanted to add to the upkeep issue:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">
&lt;pre class='chroma'>&lt;code class='language-r' data-lang='r'>&lt;span>&lt;span class='nv'>upkeep_bullets&lt;/span> &lt;span class='o'>&amp;lt;-&lt;/span> &lt;span class='kr'>function&lt;/span>&lt;span class='o'>(&lt;/span>&lt;span class='o'>)&lt;/span> &lt;span class='s'>"Update bundled mapshaper node library."&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>And then called &lt;code>use_upkeep_issue()&lt;/code> in my rmapshaper package directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">

&lt;p>In a fun confluence of events, while working on this post I attended an
&lt;a href="https://ropensci.org/events/coworking-2023-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rOpenSci coworking session&lt;/a> where the topic of the day was spring cleaning! We chatted about the benefits of regular upkeep, and what types of tasks make good spring cleaning issues. It was really inspiring and validating to connect with other people tackling maintenance like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this will provide a starting point, and motivate you to take care of those nagging maintenance issues, whether it be in the Spring (whenever that is in your part of the world), or any other time of the year.

&lt;p>At a high level, this guide walks you through the perspectives of both the pull request author and the pull request reviewer, discussing various aspects of the process from both points of view (such as how to

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>R 4.1.0 introduced a native pipe operator, &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. As described in the
&lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/NEWS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R News&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>R now provides a simple native forward pipe syntax &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. The simple form of the forward pipe inserts the left-hand side as the first argument in the right-hand side call. The pipe implementation as a syntax transformation was motivated by suggestions from Jim Hester and Lionel Henry.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The behaviour of the native pipe is by and large the same as that of the
&lt;a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>&lt;/a> pipe provided by the &lt;strong>magrittr&lt;/strong> package. Both operators (&lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>) let you &amp;ldquo;pipe&amp;rdquo; an object forward to a function or call expression, thereby allowing you to express a sequence of operations that transform an object.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To learn more about the basic utility of pipes, see
&lt;a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#the-pipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The pipe&lt;/a> section of R for Data Science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily there&amp;rsquo;s no need to commit entirely to one pipe or the other &amp;mdash; you can use the base pipe for the majority of cases where it&amp;rsquo;s sufficient and use the magrittr pipe when you really need its special features.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="-vs">&lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> vs. &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>
&lt;a href="#-vs">

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> and &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> behave identically for simple cases, there are a few crucial differences. These are most likely to affect you if you&amp;rsquo;re a long-term user of &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> who has taken advantage of some of the more advanced features. But they&amp;rsquo;re still good to know about even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> because you&amp;rsquo;re likely to encounter some of them when reading wild-caught code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By default, the pipe passes the object on its left-hand side to the first argument of the function on the right-hand side. &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> allows you to change the placement with a &lt;code>.&lt;/code> placeholder. For example, &lt;code>x %&amp;gt;% f(1)&lt;/code> is equivalent to &lt;code>f(x, 1)&lt;/code> but &lt;code>x %&amp;gt;% f(1, .)&lt;/code> is equivalent to &lt;code>f(1, x)&lt;/code>. R 4.2.0 added a &lt;code>_&lt;/code> placeholder to the base pipe, with one additional restriction: the argument has to be named. For example, &lt;code>x |&amp;gt; f(1, y = _)&lt;/code> is equivalent to &lt;code>f(1, y = x)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> placeholder is deliberately simple and can&amp;rsquo;t replicate many features of the &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> placeholder: you can&amp;rsquo;t pass it to multiple arguments, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any special behavior when the placeholder is used inside another function. For example, &lt;code>df %&amp;gt;% split(.$var)&lt;/code> is equivalent to &lt;code>split(df, df$var)&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>df %&amp;gt;% {split(.$x, .$y)}&lt;/code> is equivalent to &lt;code>split(df$x, df$y)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With &lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code>, you can use &lt;code>.&lt;/code> on the left-hand side of operators like &lt;code>$&lt;/code>, &lt;code>[[&lt;/code>, &lt;code>[&lt;/code> , so you can extract a single column from a data frame with (e.g.) &lt;code>mtcars %&amp;gt;% .$cyl&lt;/code>. R added support for this feature in R 4.3.0. For the special case of extracting a column out of a data frame, you can also use &lt;code>dplyr::pull()&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">
&lt;pre class='chroma'>&lt;code class='language-r' data-lang='r'>&lt;span>&lt;span class='nv'>mtcars&lt;/span> &lt;span class='o'>|&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span class='nf'>pull&lt;/span>&lt;span class='o'>(&lt;/span>&lt;span class='nv'>cyl&lt;/span>&lt;span class='o'>)&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> allows you to drop the parentheses when calling a function with no other arguments; &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> always requires the parentheses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>%&amp;gt;%&lt;/code> allows you to start a pipe with &lt;code>.&lt;/code> to create a function rather than immediately executing the pipe; this is not supported by the base pipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Because the native pipe wasn&amp;rsquo;t introduced until 4.1.0, code using &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code> in function reference examples or vignettes will not work on older versions of R, as it is not valid syntax. This is a problem for the tidyverse because our
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/04/r-version-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">versioning policies&lt;/a> mean that our packages need to work on R 3.5.0 and later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does this mean that you need to increase the minimum R version your package depends on in order to use &lt;code>|&amp;gt;&lt;/code>? Not necessarily: there are two techniques we can use to keep vignettes and examples working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the base pipe is used in purrr 1.0.0. As can be seen in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/commit/df4630c6e8cd5028386ee96b9036f1755f26adc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source for the &amp;ldquo;purrr &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; base R&amp;rdquo; vignette&lt;/a>, certain code chunks are evaluated conditionally based on the version of R being used. The setup chunk for the vignette includes: &lt;code>modern_r &amp;lt;- getRversion() &amp;gt;= &amp;quot;4.1.0&amp;quot;&lt;/code>. The results of this are then used in the &lt;code>eval&lt;/code> argument to determine whether or not a code chunk that relies on &amp;ldquo;modern R&amp;rdquo; syntax should be run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other place we use the base pipe is in examples. To disable these we use a bit of a hack that requires three files
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/main/configure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>configure&lt;/code>&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/main/cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>cleanup&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/blob/main/tools/examples.R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>tools/examples.R&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. The basic idea is for pre-R 4.1.0 we re-define the &lt;code>\examples{}&lt;/code> tag to display an informative message but not run the code; this ensures that &lt;code>R CMD check&lt;/code> continues to work even on older versions of R.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Come work with us in Developer Relations</title><link>https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/09/devrel-hiring-2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/09/devrel-hiring-2022/</guid><description>&lt;!--

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re hiring!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key part of what we do in open source at RStudio is help users learn and flourish by developing and disseminating documentation and fostering a welcoming community. To grow our capacity we&amp;rsquo;re hiring for a couple of roles in developer relations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/about/job-posting/?gh_jid=5295125003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Educator - tidyverse package development&lt;/a> &lt;br> This role will teach package development, contribute to documentation, articulate user needs, and engage in package development activities, particularly on packages like roxygen2, testthat, devtools, and usethis that form a fundamental part of our package development workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/about/job-posting/?gh_jid=5314591003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Advocate - Quarto&lt;/a> &lt;br> This role will focus on connecting with the community of Quarto users and developers to share knowledge and updates, listen to community needs and interests, be responsive and foster community around Quarto in R, Python and other languages. As a data scientist yourself, you will connect with the data science community, understand pain points, and identify and help create relevant documentation resources. We also expect that you&amp;rsquo;ll become an expert in Quarto and contribute meaningfully through GitHub issues, discussions, and PRs, and help articulate user needs and work with other developers to implement these needs into bigger features.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In both of these roles, we&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted the &amp;lsquo;developer&amp;rsquo; aspect of the role. We recognize that it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to teach or share about something well if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity to do it with some regularity. The developer educator and developer advocate roles are therefore dual purpose - you will be both a developer and an educator or advocate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these roles you&amp;rsquo;ll know how to use content creation tools to produce pedagogically appropriate and accessible resources to guide data scientists. We particularly encourage folks who are fluent in Spanish to apply. We want to help better support the Latin American R community to continue to build out documentation and learning resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please see the postings for more information about these roles, and share broadly! International applications are encouraged. We will begin reviewing applications on &lt;strong>September 28th&lt;/strong> and the positions will remain open until filled. We&amp;rsquo;re excited about this opportunity to expand our education and outreach efforts and look forward to continuing to work together with the community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Re-licensing packages: a retrospective</title><link>https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/relicensing-packages/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/12/relicensing-packages/</guid><description>&lt;!--

&lt;p>The tidyverse (including tidymodels and r-lib) includes packages that have been written over the course of 15 years. Unfortunately this has lead to a diversity of licenses &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. It is fundamentally important that software has a license, because without it no one knows how they can use it. While our packages already had open source licenses, when we looked at them holistically, we realised that we used a rather large variety of licenses, including MIT, BSD, GPL (versions 2 and 3), and more! While nothing is wrong with any of these licenses individually, the collective variety makes things confusing, particularly for people or organizations who want to use multiple packages together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reduce this confusion and make it clear that our packages are an unconditional gift that can be freely used without reciprocal obligation, we embarked on a journey to apply the same license to as many of our packages as possible (we couldn&amp;rsquo;t apply the same license to every package because some packages bundled code with incompatible licenses). No license is perfect, but we had to choose one, and after much discussion we decided on
&lt;a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MIT License&lt;/a>. The MIT License is short (171 words), widespread, relatively easy to understand (see lawyer/programmer Kyle E. Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2016/09/21/MIT-License-Line-by-Line.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;The MIT License, Line by Line&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> for details), and very permissive. MIT is not &amp;ldquo;copyleft&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hereditary&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> which require that derivative works&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> must be licensed under the same license (e.g. GPL) and be subject to (aka &amp;ldquo;inherit&amp;rdquo;) all of its restrictions .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we decided on the MIT license, we needed to check with all the authors of the code to make sure it was OK to relicense it. This involved several steps. We started by reviewing all commits made by non-RStudio contributors&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> to each package. We then contacted all (~500) contributors whose changes could constitute a copyrightable contribution (i.e. anything other than minor edits, such as typo fixes) via GitHub, e-mail, or (in a limited number of cases) personal communication requesting their statement of agreement&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see an example of the process in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/issues/805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the re-licensing issue for purrr&lt;/a>. The re-licensing generated some discussion but we were grateful to receive unanimous agreement to re-license, thus avoiding the need to re-implement any existing code&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bulk of our packages are now under MIT, which means they&amp;rsquo;re consistent (yay!), and you can continue to use them as you were before (especially since we didn&amp;rsquo;t think there was any problem using them for any reason under their previous licenses).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post has been a long time coming, and (by necessity) gives a reductive summary of nuanced topics. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn more about copyright and intellectual-property law as it pertains to open-source software, I recommend the following four books:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Open Source Licensing: Software Freedom and Intellectual Property Law&lt;/strong> by Lawrence Rosen (2004). Available from Rosen free online at &lt;a href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/oslbook.htm">http://www.rosenlaw.com/oslbook.htm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing&lt;/strong> by Andrew M. St. Laurent (2004).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting Code&lt;/strong> by Van Lindberg (2008).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>A license is an agreement in which a licensee is given permission to use the property by the property holder.

&lt;a href="https://connect.rstudioservices.com/tidymodels-priorities-survey/README.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The results&lt;/a> gave us a good sense of which items people were most interested in. The top three requests were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Model stacking!&lt;/strong> This ended up resulting in the
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonpcouch/status/1347288263472553984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award&lt;/a>-winning
&lt;a href="https://stacks.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stacks package&lt;/a> by our intern Simon Couch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Model ops (deploying and monitoring models).&lt;/strong> We are currently working on this from
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge/status/1440784933576851456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple fronts&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Adaptive resampling and better parallel processing.&lt;/strong> The
&lt;a href="https://finetune.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finetune package&lt;/a> solved the first part and some work
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidymodels/tune/pull/305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the tune package&lt;/a> resolved the second.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Almost everything that respondents prioritized highly last year has either been completed or is currently in progress. Most of our time right now is spent on model ops, survival analysis, and case weights. That work will take us through the end of the year (at least). Since this survey seemed to work well last year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use it again to prioritize features for next year.&lt;/p>

There are some items we&amp;rsquo;ve put &amp;ldquo;on the menu&amp;rdquo; but you can write in other items that you are interested in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current slate of our possibile priorities include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Model fairness analysis and metrics&lt;/strong>: Techniques to measure if there are biases in model predictions that treat groups or individuals unfairly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Supervised feature selection&lt;/strong>: This includes basic supervised filtering methods as well as techniques such as recursive feature elimination.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>H2O integration&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;d like for users to be able to have fully featured access to the excellent
&lt;a href="https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2O&lt;/a> platform via a tidymodels interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Post modeling probability calibration&lt;/strong>: Methods to characterize (and correct) probability predictions to make sure that probability estimates reflect the observed event rate(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Probability cut point optimization&lt;/strong> (for two class models): Maybe a 50% probability threshold is not optimal for your application. We&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to optimize this in the same way as the tuning parameters associated with models and recipes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spatial analysis models and methods&lt;/strong>: We have started to work on
&lt;a href="https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spatial resampling&lt;/a> but want to include more comprehensive support for spatial modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Better serialization tools&lt;/strong>: Some frameworks (e.g. keras, xgboost, and others) store their models in memory. If you save the associated R object, you lose the model results. This project would create better tools for saving and reloading model objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="http://www.user2019.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useR! 2019&lt;/a> in Toulouse. It was a fun day, and we managed to merge around &lt;strong>40&lt;/strong> pull

&lt;!--html_preserve-->&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Huge thanks to everyone who contributed to tidyverse developer day! We merged over 40 PRs and have almost 30 more to review over the next few days &lt;a href="https://t.co/uM9Tg1dMeX">pic.twitter.com/uM9Tg1dMeX&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1148252922272190464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2019&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;!--/html_preserve-->
&lt;p>The event was particularly successful thanks to a few changes we made after our
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/tidyverse-developer-day-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first try&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🤝 &lt;strong>Helpers&lt;/strong> The goal of TDD is to provide
opportunities for everyone to contribute, regardless of their level of
expertise. This time we made sure to recruit plenty of helpers (~20 for
~70 participants) and to clearly identify them with snazzy nametags. Having
friendly faces circulating and ready to lend a hand made the event much
warmer for newcomers (and helping others is pretty satisfying, too).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🏷 &lt;strong>Post-its&lt;/strong> Searching GitHub issues for a problem you
can help solve is hard enough at the best of times, but it&amp;rsquo;s darn near
impossible when you&amp;rsquo;re competing with a room full of people. To make it
easier we went back to the basics and paired every GitHub issue with a
colour-coded sticky note. This made it much easier to find issues, and
as a side-benefit made it possible to see collective progress over the day
as post-its migrated from &lt;code>To Do&lt;/code> to &lt;code>Under Review&lt;/code> to &lt;code>Done&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🛎 &lt;strong>The gong&lt;/strong> Getting your PR merged is a cause for
celebration, and Hadley likes to travel with a gong. It was only natural
to combine these two truths by ringing the gong every time a PR was merged!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We will be hosting our next tidyverse dev day on &lt;strong>January 31st&lt;/strong> in San
Francisco, following
&lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rstudio::conf(2020)&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Note that, as described in the R Developer
&lt;a href="https://developer.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;Release plans&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, R version releases occur annually in Spring. We generally update the required version in package metadata on the next package release after the R release, so you may see older versions listed in published CRAN packages.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/05/pkgdown-1-0-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>pkgdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> had its initial release on CRAN. pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package, and has already been used to make sites for over 2500 packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several major tidyverse package releases have centered on the implementation of
&lt;a href="https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>tidy evaluation&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Notable among these was the 3.0.0 release of
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/07/ggplot2-3-0-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>ggplot2&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, which has more than 2000 reverse dependencies. We continue to improve our tools for and skills with releases with large numbers of reverse dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/10/devtools-2-0-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>devtools 2.0.0&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> split the functionality in devtools into a number of smaller packages which are simpler to develop, and also easier for other packages to depend on. Though devtools will remain the primary package with which developers interact, the functionality will come from its component packages (in what we’re calling a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/devtools#conscious-uncoupling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conscious uncoupling&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidymodels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>tidymodels&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> collection is the home of several new modelling packages, which follow opinionated but reasonable
&lt;a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">model implementation practices&lt;/a>. This includes the
&lt;a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>parsnip&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> package, which standardizes the interface for fitting models as well as their return values — separating model &lt;em>specification&lt;/em> from model &lt;em>implementation&lt;/em> (
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/11/parsnip-0-0-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more detail here&lt;/a>). In effect, when using parsnip, you don’t have to remember each interface and its unique set of argument names to easily move between R packages.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Among the
&lt;a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidyverse development principles&lt;/a> is the goal of being
&lt;a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org/unifying-principles.html#consistent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent&lt;/a>. This has, perhaps, been most visible in our implementation of
&lt;a href="https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tidy evaluation&lt;/a> across tidyverse packages. The
&lt;a href="https://fs.r-lib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>fs&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> r-lib package, first released at the beginning of the year, helps bring such consistency to file system operations. More recently, we’ve devised a consistent strategy for handling
&lt;a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org/names-attribute.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">name repair&lt;/a> that can be used to make name-handling more predictable.
&lt;a href="https://vctrs.r-lib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>vctrs&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, which recently had its first CRAN release, will allow us to bring
&lt;a href="https://vctrs.r-lib.org/articles/stability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">type- and size-stability&lt;/a> to user-facing functions; a major focus as we head into the next year.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>📍 &lt;strong>Where:&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="https://www.sunsetroomaustin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sunset Room&lt;/a>, just a couple blocks away from where rstudio::conf is being held.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>👥 &lt;strong>Who:&lt;/strong> Anyone who would like to get better at contributing to the tidyverse! Everyone is welcome regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;ve never done a PR before, or if you&amp;rsquo;ve already made your 10th package.&lt;/li>

breakfast, lunch, snacks, and coffee; you&amp;rsquo;ll bring your laptop and enthusiasm.

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The broad goal of this event is to nurture regular contributors. The tidyverse team will be there, so we can help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that you encounter. Don&amp;rsquo;t have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We&amp;rsquo;ll be tagging issues in advance to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s lots to do for any- and everyone, regardless of level of expertise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll have tables led by different members of the team focusing on topics including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First-time contributions,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Code makeovers,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rlang and tidy eval,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Primers,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spanish translations,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modelling, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repo hygiene.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

we&amp;rsquo;ll be holding our first ever &lt;strong>tidyverse developer day&lt;/strong>, and you&amp;rsquo;re invited!
So, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, plan on being in Austin on the 19th of January.
The venue is not settled yet, but the intent is to make it convenient for
people who’ve chosen lodging based on the rstudio::conf location.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There will be more details to come, but the idea is to have a day where we
can work together on anything ranging from submitting your first pull request,
to working on your own package. The tidyverse team will be there, so we can
help you hit the ground running and/or get over any stumbling blocks that you
encounter. Don&amp;rsquo;t have any ideas for something to work on? No problem! We&amp;rsquo;ll

&lt;a href="https://user2018.r-project.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useR! 2018 Brisbane&lt;/a> nearly upon us!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conference talks are a great opportunity to help people learn about the cool and useful things you have built. Given all the hard work you&amp;rsquo;ve already put in, a bit of marketing effort can be a wise investment in drumming up users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making your talk easy for others to promote is like
&lt;a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal design&lt;/a>: it makes your accomplishment more accessible for everyone, whether or not they use Twitter or maintain a blog. It&amp;rsquo;s another version of the

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We provide concrete tips to make your product easier for others to appreciate. Even if you can only dedicate 30 minutes or a couple of hours to this, you should find a few things here that feel doable and worth it. No one does all of this, nor do they need to. At the end, we link to an annotated, crowd-sourced list of great examples of talk-based marketing. We also draw on this for examples along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We assume that your product already exists and is ready to share with others. We assume that it is already documented. For example, if it&amp;rsquo;s a package, we assume you already have a good README, vignettes, or articles. There should be a way for someone to learn about your product and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> install it. Realistically, this order of operations is much more likely than &amp;ldquo;install on blind faith, then figure out what it does&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is not about how to build a high-quality package, how to write documentation, or how to give a great talk. We include a few links to such resources below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First, deal with the word and concept of &amp;ldquo;marketing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Marketing is the study and management of exchange relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; &lt;cite>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing&lt;/a>&lt;/cite>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you have taken the trouble to build an R package, Shiny app, tutorial, or talk, presumably you would like people to know about it and use it! Marketing is the set of activities that help your target audience:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>discover that your thing exists,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>learn how your thing could benefit them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some creators take a peculiar pride in being &amp;ldquo;bad at marketing,&amp;rdquo; but it is not some elusive skill. Nor is marketing effort a sign that your work isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough to sell itself. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to digest all the exciting developments in the R world! It&amp;rsquo;s a kindness to the community if you make it easy to find and appreciate your work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can acknowledge the value in marketing or you can declare that cultivating broader usage is not a goal. Pick one.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pick one primary landing page for your product. Here are some possibilities, illustrated with the infer package:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A dedicated website, possibly made with
&lt;a href="http://pkgdown.r-lib.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pkgdown&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blogdown&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bookdown&lt;/a>, or, in the case of
&lt;a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny&lt;/a>, a
&lt;a href="https://www.shinyapps.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running app&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://infer.netlify.com">https://infer.netlify.com&lt;/a> is a site generated with pkgdown and the landing page has links to GitHub, CRAN, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A development venue, such as a
&lt;a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository&lt;/a>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/andrewpbray/infer">https://github.com/andrewpbray/infer&lt;/a> features a link to main pkgdown site, plus a badge that links to CRAN.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A
&lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRAN&lt;/a> package landing page
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/infer/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/infer/index.html&lt;/a> links to development repo on GitHub in URL and BugReports field.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Visit this with the eyes of a newcomer. Do you show basic usage? Do you define key terms and acronyms? If your product is related to vis, are there any actual visualizations? Refine accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ggrepel&lt;/a> is a good example of a README for a vis package that includes figures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If your thing has multiple online homes, make sure they are interlinked. There should be a strong push towards the primary home, which then links out to the other locations. Here is a visual review of key online resources (plus a title slide) for the infer package example, with important hyperlinks and identifiers highlighted.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;p>As you give talks or write papers related to your product, be sure to incorporate the associated links back into the primary online home or docs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Take a hard look at your product&amp;rsquo;s URL. Is it short, memorable, and informative? If not, work on that. Options include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Give it a nice URL within your own website. Examples: &lt;a href="https://earo.me/talk/">https://earo.me/talk/&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/">http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://alison.rbind.io/talk/ohsu-biodatavis/">https://alison.rbind.io/talk/ohsu-biodatavis/&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purchase a domain (typical cost is $5-$20/year). Example:
&lt;a href="http://happygitwithr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">happygitwithr.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make a shortlink using a service, such as &lt;a href="http://bit.ly">http://bit.ly&lt;/a>. Examples: Maëlle Salmon&amp;rsquo;s recent talk at Rencontres R &lt;a href="http://bit.do/rr2018">http://bit.do/rr2018&lt;/a>, Jenny Bryan webinar on row-oriented workflows &lt;a href="https://rstd.io/row-work">https://rstd.io/row-work&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ideally your URL is easy to hold in human memory long enough to type it with fat fingers, on a phone. In some settings, you might even include this URL and/or a Twitter handle in the slide footer, so it&amp;rsquo;s visible at all times.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personal-online-home-and-shortlink">Personal online home and shortlink
&lt;a href="#personal-online-home-and-shortlink">
&lt;svg class="anchor-symbol" aria-hidden="true" height="26" width="26" viewBox="0 0 22 22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been considering a Twitter account, go ahead and get one, even if you have no immediate plans to be active. Why? A Twitter handle can serve as a great shortlink for you as a person. You can include a link to your primary online presence in your Twitter profile. If people tweet about your talk and product, they will want to &lt;code>@&lt;/code> mention you. And that, in turn, lets you see the reaction and join in any downstream conversations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="title-slide">Title slide
&lt;a href="#title-slide">
&lt;svg class="anchor-symbol" aria-hidden="true" height="26" width="26" viewBox="0 0 22 22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
&lt;path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="currentColor">&lt;/path>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Make a slide with the most important coordinates for you and your thing. Include this as the first or second slide. This slide should include one or more of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your product&amp;rsquo;s name and primary URL or shortlink.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your name and primary URL(s), handles, or usernames.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>DO THIS IN AN ABSOLUTELY HUGE FONT. Now is not the time for subtlety or mumbling &amp;ldquo;I know this is hard to read, but &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;. Incorporate an evocative image or logo as appropriate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leave this slide up for a bigly amount of time, so people have ample opportunity to get out their phones and fire up the camera. Do not flash this vital slide for 3 seconds, only to spend 2 minutes displaying a bulleted outline of your talk. Consider omitting your outline slide and, instead, verbally convey this overview while displaying your title slide.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing-slide">Closing slide
&lt;a href="#closing-slide">

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Make a conclusion slide to display as you wrap up and take questions. It should repeat key URLs and handles from the title slide. Consider doing that in a smaller font, so you have room to recap a few key points. This delivers more value than a generic &amp;ldquo;THANK YOU&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Questions?&amp;rdquo; slide that lacks identifying content.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Accept that people photograph and share individual slides, e.g., via Twitter. This can be a good thing, especially if you harness it for your ends! If an audience member is moved to share your thing, it is natural they want to enhance the basic message with an evocative slide or image. Think about how well your slides work with this predictable behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If something would be terrible taken out of context or circulated widely, reflect on that and take appropriate measures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a pithy and hilarious point, give that slide some extra attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some resources for live-tweeting. If you&amp;rsquo;d like people to tweet about your talk, make it easy for them. This is just like grant-writing: notice the words the funder uses to describe what they want to fund and describe your work in those terms.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="post-materials-before-the-talk">Post materials &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the talk
&lt;a href="#post-materials-before-the-talk">

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Choose your primary online home and humane URL &lt;em>before your talk&lt;/em>. It is very tempting, but sub-optimal, to promise the slides or materials &amp;ldquo;after the talk&amp;rdquo;. People are taking notes and photos right now, during your talk, and this is your best chance to tell them how to find your awesome thing when they get home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you add more materials or update your slides after the talk, it is still worth it to publicize the URL during the talk. Tweets come up in searches months and years later and wrap-up blog posts will come out over the next couple of weeks. Most of the genuine visits to your thing will happen later, but your talk represents the best opportunity to put the URL in front of people&amp;rsquo;s eyeballs.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When sharing slides, the main point is to minimize friction for the consumer. Making slides in Rmd is great; making readers clone your repo, install any necessary packages, and knit the document in order to see your slides is not.
The way &lt;em>you&lt;/em> store, interact with, and present your slides is not necessarily a great distribution platform, although it is certainly better than keeping them to yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slide-specific platforms, such as
&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpeakerDeck&lt;/a>, are the best for pleasant and immediate browsing, linking to specific slides, and embedding in blogs or websites. The main downside is that hyperlinks in slides viewed this way are not immediately clickable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PDF files can be shared in a GitHub repo, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a very pleasant browsing experience, especially if the file is large. Raw R Markdown or HTML on GitHub are even more frustrating because they are not immediately consumable by the user. Video is also not a great primary source, as the perceived time commitment can be off-putting and it is often awkward to consume in the workplace.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When in doubt, over-credit and over-thank others whose work has enhanced yours, directly or indirectly. This is much better than under-crediting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t use other people&amp;rsquo;s work without permission. Comply with licenses and always give attribution. Link back to the source and original creator whenever possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tricky mechanical question is where to provide information, such as photo credit. Some people include it directly on every slide, but that can create visual clutter. Others collect in a designated place, such as an acknowledgement section or document. Find a method that you feel is fair and aesthetically acceptable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A couple of months back, we sent out the following email to the maintainers of
packages on CRAN with &lt;a href="http://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse&lt;/a> listed in
either Depends, Imports, or Suggests:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dear &lt;code>{maintainer}&lt;/code>,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of &lt;code>{date}&lt;/code>, your package, &lt;code>{package_name}&lt;/code>, lists the tidyverse package in
either Depends, Imports, or Suggests on CRAN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the tidyverse is a set of packages designed for interactive data
analysis, this is, in short, a bad idea. The tidyverse package includes a
substantial number of direct and indirect dependencies (79 packages, as of this
writing), many of which are likely unnecessary for the purposes of your package.
Furthermore, the CRAN maintainers frown upon depending on it, which can cause
hassle for you down the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you could please correct this by importing functions from, suggesting,
or depending on the tidyverse component packages you require at your nearest
convenience, it would be most appreciated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please let us know if you have any questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you,&lt;/p>
Hadley Wickham&lt;br />

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.tidyverse.org/css/article-image.css" type="text/css" />
&lt;p>Contributions to the tidyverse, and to open source software in general can
be framed as various forms of “feedback.” Giving useful feedback can be hard!
That’s one of the reasons that &lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/">&lt;strong>File issues&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
is part of our contributing guide. Hopefully, it’s a mutually-beneficial endeavor
— if you’ve found a bug while &lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/">getting help&lt;/a>,
we want to know about it so we can improve the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the purposes of this post, let’s suppose you’ve found a bug or there’s a
feature you’d like to see added to one of your favourite packages. Being the
thoughtful user that you are, you’ve made your way to the appropriate GitHub
repo. Before writing anything, you search the existing issues to see if it’s
already there, or perhaps you’ve landed yourself in the open issue by way of
searching for your error message. The point is: you have an issue, and you’re
not alone — someone’s beat you to the punch/blazed a trail ahead of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes you’ll have something to add to the conversation (like adding a
&lt;a href="http://reprex.tidyverse.org/">reprex&lt;/a> if one doesn’t exist, or making an
existing reprex more minimal), but that’s not always the case. This is precisely
what &lt;a href="https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/">GitHub Reactions&lt;/a> were meant for. To quote from their launch
post:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We’re adding Reactions to conversations today to help people express their
feelings more simply and effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Feedback that falls on deaf ears isn’t worth much, so we’ve started tracking
these using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/gh">gh&lt;/a> package and &lt;a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#list-reactions-for-an-issue">GitHub’s API&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>GET /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/reactions&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>GitHub has six reaction types, but we’ve bagged them into two categories,
&lt;code>:+1:&lt;/code> (thumbs up), and the others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/images/upvoting-issues/reaction_types.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we pull the repo, issue, and reaction data together we end up with
something that looks like the following figure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/images/upvoting-issues/tidyverse_issue_reactions.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a far cry from a fancy report, but it provides another avenue for easy
communication among users and developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="how-do-i-react" class="section level4">
&lt;h4>How do I react?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As long as you have a GitHub account, all you need to do is click-and-pick.
This isn’t a &lt;em>true&lt;/em> upvoting system, just a way of saying &lt;code>+1&lt;/code> without having
to write a comment to that same effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/images/upvoting-issues/pkgdown_upvoting.gif" />&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="what-if-the-issue-is-closed" class="section level4">
&lt;h4>What if the issue is closed?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>We are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> tracking reactions on closed issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="what-about-comments" class="section level4">
&lt;h4>What about comments?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Comments are great, and they’re not going away. Tracking upvotes is intended to
be an at-a-glance indicator. Comments don’t serve this purpose quite so well, as
they can be positive, negative, or anything in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.tidyverse.org/images/upvoting-issues/pkgdown_comment.gif" />&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="does-this-mean-that-issues-will-be-dealt-with-sequentially-by-popular-demand" class="section level4">
&lt;h4>Does this mean that issues will be dealt with sequentially by popular demand?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Nope. While we want and value your feedback, our development process isn’t a
popularity contest — we carefully weigh the severity of the issue, the number
of people it affects, our estimate of how much time it will take to fix, and our
current development foci to decide what to work on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div id="tldr" class="section level3">
&lt;h3>TL;DR&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you go to a GitHub repo to file an issue/request a feature and find an open
thread, give it a thumbs up: we are listening!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In an effort to keep the community up to date with the evolution of the tidyverse, we’ll be doing regular roundups cataloging the latest developments.&lt;/p>
&lt;section id="tidyverse-package-updates" class="level2">
&lt;h2>tidyverse package updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/tidyverse_1.2.0/">tidyverse 1.2.0 &lt;i class="fa fa-file ">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/releases/">release notes&lt;/a>)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>membership changes, with &lt;a href="http://stringr.tidyverse.org">stringr&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://forcats.tidyverse.org">forcats&lt;/a> moving to the core, and the addition of the &lt;a href="http://reprex.tidyverse.org/">reprex&lt;/a> package&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/lubridate-1.7.0/">lubridate 1.7.0 &lt;i class="fa fa-file ">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/releases">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>rlang 0.1.4 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang/releases">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>tidyselect 0.2.3 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyselect/releases">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;section id="tidyselect" class="level3">
&lt;h3>tidyselect&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>tidyselect provides a common back-end for &lt;code>dplyr::select()&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tidyr::gather()&lt;/code>, as well as for modelling packages. It is also the source of selection helpers, such as &lt;code>everything()&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>starts_with()&lt;/code>. tidyselect allows you to create selecting verbs that are consistent across tidyverse packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>
&lt;section id="tidy-models" class="level3">
&lt;h3>tidy models&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/yardstick/">yardstick&lt;/a> allows you to easily create tidy performance estimates. Using a syntax similar to dplyr’s you can compute common performance metrics, such as precision, and recall (for classification), or numeric metric outcomes for regression, and have them returned in a tidy data frame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/recipes/">recipes&lt;/a> is an extensible framework for feature selection and the creation of preprocess design matrices, which can then be applied to statistical and machine learning models. The updated version of recipes includes a tidy method for many of the step functions. The tidy method returns relevant information about the step. This could include estimated parameters or which variables were affected by the step. &lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/recipes/news/index.html">NEWS&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/rsample/">rsample&lt;/a>’s major upgrade from caret is that it allows for &lt;em>nested&lt;/em> resampling. The goal is to have a modular, extensible set of methods that can be used across R packages for traditional resampling techniques, and estimating model performance. rsample can be used to create objects containing resamples of the original data, allowing you to create a model and optimization parameters with placeholders for features to be defined later. The &lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/rsample/">package website&lt;/a> has examples for resampling time series, survival models, and neural networks using &lt;code>tensorflow&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/rsample/news/index.html">NEWS&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://topepo.github.io/tidyposterior/">tidyposterior&lt;/a> is used to conduct Bayesian &lt;em>post hoc&lt;/em> analyses of resampling results generated by models. It can be considered an upgraded version of &lt;code>caret::resample&lt;/code>. Though it works natively with rsample, it can be used with any data frame of results.&lt;/p>
&lt;/section>
&lt;/section>
&lt;section id="r-lib" class="level2">
&lt;h2>r-lib&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the tidyverse consists of highly-opinionated tools for data science; r-lib contains mostly-unopinionated infrastructure tools with fewer dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;section id="package-updates" class="level3">
&lt;h3>package updates&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/withr-2.1.0/">withr 2.1.0 &lt;i class="fa fa-file ">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/withr/releases">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/usethis-1.0.0/">usethis 1.0.0 (and 1.1.0) &lt;i class="fa fa-file ">&lt;/i>&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/releases/tag/v1.1.0">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>cli 1.0.0 now on &lt;a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cli/">CRAN&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;p>roxygen2md 0.4.0 (&lt;a href="https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2md/releases/tag/v0.0-4">release notes&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/section>

We are working hard to make tidyverse.org &lt;strong>the&lt;/strong> place to go to learn the tidyverse and to keep up to date with it as it evolves. We want &lt;a href="https://tidyverse.org">https://tidyverse.org&lt;/a> to be your one stop shop for everything tidy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As well as radically improved graphic design, the site includes four new components:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages">Packages&lt;/a>: a listing of all packages in the tidyverse,
broken down by domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/learn">Learn&lt;/a>: our advice on learning the tidyverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help">Help&lt;/a>: are you stuck on something involving the tidyverse?
Learn how to write
&lt;a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help#reprex">a reprex&lt;/a> then learn where to ask for
help.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>This blog! Expect to see regular updates on what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the
tidyverse. This includes package updates, in person events, and
